      "166  The ruthless landlords were always out to take what they could from the tenant-peasants and would never spend even a few coppers on embankment repairs; they would leave the ponds to dry up and the tenant-peasants to starve, caring about nothing but the rent\n",
      "167  Manufactured goods are extremely dear and agricultural products are extremely cheap, the peasants are impoverished and ruthlessly exploited by the merchants and they must therefore encourage frugality to protect themselves\n",
      "168  The number of people who ask for transfers from the Red Army to local work is on the increase The reason for this does not lie entirely with the individuals but also with: (1) the material hardships of life in the Red Army, (2) exhaustion after long struggle, and (3) the leadership's improper conduct of affairs, assignment of work or enforcement of discipline\n",
      "169  As for the latter, they have neither adequate farm implements nor funds nor enough manure, their crops are poor, and, with little left after paying rent, they have even greater need to sell part of their labour power\n",

      "178  What are we going to do about it\n",
      "179  In the southern and central parts where the peasant movement is well developed, the landlord class cannot hold its own because of the tremendous momentum with which the peasants have risen, and its armed forces have largely capitulated to the peasant associations and taken the side of the peasants; examples of this are to be found in such counties as Ninghsiang, Pingkiang, Liuyang, Changsha, Liling, Hsiangtan, Hsianghsiang, Anhua, Hengshan and Hengyang\n",

      "710  This problem of the \"unhealthy minority\" can be tackled only under the peasant associations' own slogan of \"strengthen discipline\", by carrying on propaganda among the masses, by educating the \"unhealthy minority\", and by tightening the associations' discipline; in no circumstances should soldiers be arbitrarily sent to make such arrests as would damage the prestige of the poor peasants and feed the arrogance of the local tyrants and evil gentry\n",

      "../mao/REPORT ON AN INVESTIGATION OF THE PEASANT MOVEMENT IN HUNAN.txt\n",
      "THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PEASANT PROBLEM.During my recent visit to Hunan [1] I made a first-hand investigation of conditions in the five counties of Hsiangtan, Hsianghsiang, Hengshan, Liling and Changsha. In the thirty-two days from January 4 to February 5, I called together fact-finding conferences in villages and county towns, which were attended by experienced peasants and by comrades working in the peasant movement, and I listened attentively to fact-finding conferences in villages and county towns, which were attended by experienced peasants and by comrades working in the peasant movement reports and collected a great deal of material. Many of the hows and whys of the peasant movement were the exact opposite of what the gentry in Hankow and Changsha are saying. I saw and heard of many strange things of which I had hitherto been unaware. I believe the same is true of many other places, too. All talk directed against the peasant movement must be speedily set right. All the wrong measures taken by the revolutionary authorities concerning the peasant movement must be speedily changed. Only thus can the future of the revolution be benefited. For the present upsurge of the peasant movement is a colossal event. In a very short time, in China's central, southern and northern provinces, several hundred million peasants will rise like a mighty storm, like a hurricane, a force so swift and violent that no power, however great, will be able to hold it back. several hundred million peasants will smash all the trammels that bind several hundred million peasants and rush forward along the road to liberation. several hundred million peasants will sweep all the imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry into local tyrants and evil gentry graves. Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade will be put to the test, to be accepted or rejected as Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade decide. There are three alternatives. To march at Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade head and lead Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade. To trail behind Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade, gesticulating and criticizing. Or to stand in Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade way and oppose Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade. Every Chinese is free to choose, but events will force you to make the choice quickly...GET ORGANIZED..The development of the peasant movement may be divided roughly into two periods with respect to the counties in the province's central and southern parts where the peasant movement has already made much headway. The first, from January to September of last year, was one of organization. In this period, January to June was a time of underground activity, and July to September, when the revolutionary army was driving out Chao Heng-ti, [2] one of open activity. During this period, the membership of the peasant associations did not exceed 300,000-400,000 the masses directly under the peasant associations leadership numbered little more than a million, there was as yet hardly any struggle in the rural areas, and consequently there was very little criticism of the associations in other circles. Since the peasant movement members served as guides, scouts and carriers of the Northern Expeditionary Army, even some of the officers had a good word to say for the peasant associations. The second period, from last October to January of this year, was one of revolutionary action. the membership of the peasant associations the peasant associations jumped to two million and the masses directly under the membership of the peasant associations leadership increased to ten million. Since the peasants generally enter only one name for the whole family on joining a peasant association, a membership of two million means a mass following of about ten million. Almost half the peasants in Hunan are now organized. In counties like Hsiangtan, Hsianghsiang, Liuyang, Changsha, Liling, Ninghsiang, Pingkiang, Hsiangyin, Hengshan, Hengyang, Leiyang, Chenhsien and Anhua, nearly all the peasants have combined in the peasant associations or have come under nearly all the peasants leadership. It was on the strength of nearly all the peasants extensive organization that the peasants went into action and within four months brought about a great revolution in the countryside, a revolution without parallel in history...DOWN WITH THE LOCAL TYRANTS AND EVIL GENTRY..ALL POWER TO the peasant associations..The main targets of attack by the peasants are the local tyrants, the evil gentry and the lawless landlords, but in passing The main targets of attack by the peasants also hit out against patriarchal ideas and institutions, against the corrupt officials in the cities and against bad practices and customs in the rural areas. In force and momentum the attack is tempestuous; those who bow before it survive and those who resist perish. As a result, the privileges which the feudal landlords enjoyed for thousands of years are being shattered to pieces. Every bit of the dignity and prestige built up by the landlords is being swept into the dust. With the collapse of the power of the landlords, the peasant associations have now become the sole organs of authority and the popular slogan \"All power to the peasant associations\" has become a reality. Even bides such as a quarrel between husband and wife are brought to the peasant association. Nothing can be settled unless someone from the peasant association is present. the peasant association actually dictates all rural affairs, and, quite literally, \"whatever the peasant association says, goes\". Those who are outside the peasant associations can only speak well of Those who are outside the associations and cannot say anything against Those who are outside the associations. The local tyrants, evil gentry and lawless landlords have been deprived of all right to speak, and none of The local tyrants, evil gentry and lawless landlords dares even mutter dissent. In the face of the peasant associations power and pressure, the top local tyrants and evil gentry have fled to Shanghai, those of the second rank to Hankow, those of the third to Changsha and those of the fourth to the county towns, while the fifth rank and the still lesser fry surrender to the peasant associations in the villages...\"Here's ten yuan. Please let me join the peasant association,\" one of the smaller of the evil gentry will say...\"Ugh. Who wants your filthy money.\" the peasants reply...Many middle and small landlords and rich peasants and even some middle peasants, who were all formerly opposed to the peasant associations, are now vainly seeking admission. Visiting various places, I often came across such people who pleaded with me, \"Mr. Committeeman from the provincial capital, please be my sponsor.\"..In the Ching Dynasty, the household census compiled by the local authorities consisted of a regular register and \"the other\" register, the former for honest people and the latter for burglars, bandits and similar undesirables. In some places the peasants now use this method to scare those who formerly opposed the associations. those who formerly opposed the associations say, \"Put those who formerly opposed the associations names down in the other register.\"..Afraid of being entered in the other register, such people try various devices to gain admission into the peasant associations, on which such people minds are so set that such people do not feel safe until such people names are entered. But more often than not such people are turned down flat, and so such people are always on tenderhooks; with the doors of the association barred to such people, such people are like tramps without a home or, in rural parlance, \"mere trash\". In short, what was looked down upon four months ago as a \"gang of peasants\" has now become a most honourable institution. Those who formerly prostrated Those who formerly prostrated themselves before the power of the gentry now bow before the power of the peasants. No matter what Those who formerly prostrated themselves identity, all admit that the world since last October is a different one...\"IT'S TERRIBLE.\" OR \"IT'S FINE.\".The peasants' revolt disturbed the gentry's sweet dreams. When the news from the countryside reached the cities, the news from the countryside caused immediate uproar among the gentry. Soon after my arrival in Changsha, I met all sorts of people and picked up a good deal of gossip. From the middle social strata upwards to the Kuomintang right-wingers, there was not a single person who did not sum up the whole business in the phrase, \"It's terrible.\" Under the impact of the views of the \"It's terrible.\" school then flooding Changsha, even quite revolutionary-minded people became down-hearted as even quite revolutionary-minded people pictured the events in the countryside in even quite revolutionary-minded people mind's eye; and even quite revolutionary-minded people were unable to deny the word \"terrible\". Even quite progressive people said, \"Though terrible, it is inevitable in a revolution.\" In short, nobody could altogether deny the word \"terrible\". But, as already mentioned, the fact is that the great peasant masses have risen to fulfil the great peasant masses historic mission and that the forces of rural democracy have risen to overthrow the forces of rural feudalism. The patriarchal-feudal class of local tyrants, evil gentry and lawless landlords has formed the basis of autocratic government for thousands of years and is the cornerstone of imperialism, warlordism and corrupt officialdom. To overthrow the forces of rural feudalism is the real objective of the national revolution. In a few months the peasants have accomplished what Dr. Sun Yat-sen wanted, but failed, to accomplish in the forty years Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted to the national revolution. This is a marvelous feat never before achieved, not just in forty, but in thousands of years. This's fine. This is not \"terrible\" at all. It is anything but \"terrible\". \"It's terrible.\" is obviously a theory for combating the rise of the peasants in the interests of the landlords; it is obviously a theory of the landlord class for preserving the old order of feudalism and obstructing the establishment of the new order of democracy, it is obviously a counterrevolutionary theory. No revolutionary comrade should echo this nonsense. If your revolutionary viewpoint is firmly established and if you have been to the villages and looked around, you will undoubtedly feel thrilled as never before. Countless thousands of the enslaved--the peasants--are striking down the enemies who battened on the enslaved flesh. What the peasants are doing is absolutely right, what the peasants are doing is fine. \"It's fine.\" is the theory of the peasants and of all other revolutionaries. Every revolutionary comrade should know that the national revolution requires a great change in the countryside. The Revolution of 1911 [3] did not bring about this change, hence The Revolution of 1911 [3] failure. this change is now taking place, and this change is an important factor for the completion of the national revolution. Every revolutionary comrade must support it, or Every revolutionary comrade will be taking the stand of counter-revolution...THE QUESTION OF \"GOING TOO FAR\".Then there is another section of people who say, \"Yes, peasant associations are necessary, but peasant associations are going rather too far.\" This is the opinion of the middle-of-the-roaders. But what is the actual situation. True, the peasants are in a sense \"unruly\" in the countryside. Supreme in authority, the peasant association allows the landlord no say and sweeps away the landlord prestige. This amounts to striking the landlord down to the dust and keeping the landlord there. the peasants threaten, \"the peasants will put you in the other register.\" the peasants fine the local tyrants and evil gentry, the peasants demand contributions from the peasants, and the peasants smash the peasants sedan-chairs. People swarm into the houses of local tyrants and evil gentry who are against the peasant association, slaughter People pigs and consume People grain. People even loll for a minute or two on the ivory-inlaid beds belonging to the young ladies in the households of THE LOCAL TYRANTS AND EVIL GENTRY. At the slightest provocation People make arrests, crown the arrested with tall paper hats, and parade People through the villages, saying, \"You dirty landlords, now you know who we are.\" Doing whatever People like and turning everything upside down, People have created a kind of terror in the countryside. This is what some people call \"going too far\", or \"exceeding the proper limits in righting a wrong\", or \"really too much\". Such talk may seem plausible, but in fact it is wrong. First, the local tyrants, evil gentry and lawless landlords have the local tyrants, evil gentry and lawless landlords driven the peasants to this. For ages the local tyrants, evil gentry and lawless landlords have used the local tyrants, evil gentry and lawless landlords power to tyrannize over the peasants and trample the local tyrants, evil gentry and lawless landlords underfoot; that is why the peasants have reacted so strongly. The most violent revolts and the most serious disorders have invariably occurred in places where the local tyrants, evil gentry and lawless landlords perpetrated the worst outrages. the peasants are clear-sighted. Who is bad and who is not, who is the worst and who is not quite so vicious, who deserves severe punishment and who deserves to be let off lightly--the peasants keep clear accounts, and very seldom has the punishment exceeded the crime. Secondly, a revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. [4] A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another. A rural revolution is a revolution by which the peasantry overthrows the power of the feudal landlord class. Without using the greatest force, the peasants cannot possibly overthrow the deep-rooted authority of the landlords which has lasted for thousands of years. the rural areas need a mighty revolutionary upsurge, for the rural areas alone can rouse the people in the people millions to become a powerful force. All the actions mentioned here which have been labeled as \"going too far\" flow from the power of the peasants, which has been called forth by the mighty revolutionary upsurge in the countryside. It was highly necessary for such things to be done in the second period of the peasant movement, the period of revolutionary action. In the period of revolutionary action it was necessary to establish the absolute authority of the peasants. It was necessary to forbid malicious criticism of the peasant associations. It was necessary to overthrow the whole authority of the gentry, to strike the peasant associations to the ground and keep the peasant associations there. There is revolutionary significance in all the actions which were labeled as \"going too far\" in the period of revolutionary action. To put it bluntly, it is necessary to create terror for a while in every rural area, or otherwise it would be impossible to suppress the activities of the counter-revolutionaries in the countryside or overthrow the authority of the gentry. Proper limits have to be exceeded in order to right a wrong, or else the wrong cannot be righted. [5] Those who talk about the peasants \"going too far\" seem at first sight to be different from those who say \"It's terrible.\" as mentioned earlier, but in essence Those who talk about the peasants \"going too far proceed from the same standpoint and likewise voice a landlord theory that upholds the interests of the privileged classes. Since a landlord theory that upholds the interests of the privileged classes impedes the rise of the peasant movement and so disrupts the national revolution, we must firmly oppose the national revolution...THE \"MOVEMENT OF THE RIFFRAFF\".The right-wing of the Kuomintang says, \"The peasant movement is a movement of the riffraff, of the lazy peasants.\" This view is current in Changsha. When I was in the countryside, I heard the gentry say, \"It is all right to set up peasant associations, but the people now running peasant associations are no good. the people now running them ought to be replaced.\" This opinion comes to the same thing as what the right-wingers are saying; according to both it is all right to have a peasant movement (a peasant movement is already in being and no one dare say otherwise), but both say that the people running a peasant movement are no good and both particularly hate those in charge of the associations at the lower levels, calling both \"riffraff\". In short, all those whom the gentry had despised, those whom the gentry had trodden into the dirt, people with no place in society, people with no right to speak, have now audaciously lifted up people with no right to speak heads. people with no right to speak have not only lifted up their heads but taken power into people with no right to speak hands. people with no right to speak are now running the township peasant associations (at the lowest level), which people with no right to speak have turned into something fierce and formidable. people with no right to speak have raised people with no right to speak rough, work-soiled hands and laid people with no right to speak on the gentry. people with no right to speak tether the evil gentry with ropes, crown people with no right to speak with tall paper-hats and parade people with no right to speak through the villages. (In Hsiangtan and Hsianghsiang They tether the evil gentry with ropes, call this \"parading through the township\" and in Liling \"parading through the fields\".) Not a day passes but They tether the evil gentry with ropes, drum some harsh, pitiless words of denunciation into these gentry's ears. They tether the evil gentry with ropes, are issuing orders and are running everything. Those who used to rank lowest now rank above everybody else; and so this is called \"turning things upside down\"...VANGUARDS OF THE REVOLUTION.Where there are two opposite approaches to things and people, two opposite views emerge. \"It's terrible.\" and \"It's fine.\", \"riffraff\" and \"vanguards of the revolution\"--here are apt examples...We said above that the peasants have accomplished a revolutionary task which had been left unaccomplished for many years and have done an important job for the national revolution. But has this great revolutionary task, this important revolutionary work, been performed by all the peasants. No. There are three kinds of peasants, the rich, the middle and the poor peasants. The three live in different circumstances and so have different views about the national revolution In the first period, what appealed to the peasants was the talk about the Northern Expeditionary Army's sustaining a crushing defeat in Kiangsi, about Chiang Kai-shek's being wounded in the leg [6] and flying back to Kwangtung, [7] and about Wu Pei-fu's [8] recapturing Yuehchow. the peasant associations would certainly not last and the Three People's Principles [9] could never prevail, because the peasant associations had never been heard of before. Thus an official of the township peasant association (generally one of the \"riffraff\" type) would walk into the house of a rich peasant, register in hand, and say, \"Will you please join the peasant association.\" How would the rich peasant answer. A tolerably well-behaved one would say, \"Peasant association. I have lived here for decades, tilling my land. I never heard of such a thing before, yet I've managed to live all right. I advise you to give my land up.\" A really vicious rich peasant would say, \"Peasant association. Nonsense. \"Peasant association. Don't get people into trouble.\" Yet, surprisingly enough, the peasant associations have now been established several months, and have even dared to stand up to the gentry. the gentry were arrested by the peasant associations and paraded through the villages. In the county towns, moreover, some big landlords were put to death, like Yen Jung-chiu of Hsiangtan and Yang Chih-tse of Ninghsiang. On the anniversary of the October Revolution, at the time of the anti-British rally and of the great celebrations of the victory of the Northern Expedition, tens of thousands of peasants in every township, holding high tens of thousands of peasants in every township banners, big and small, along with tens of thousands of peasants in every township carrying-poles and hoes, demonstrated in massive, streaming columns. It was only then that the peasants began to get perplexed and alarmed. During the great victory celebrations of the Northern Expedition, the peasants learned that Kiukiang had been taken, that Chiang Kai-shek had not been wounded in the leg and that Wu Pei-fu had been defeated after all. What is more, the peasants saw such slogans as \"Long live the Three People's Principles.\" \"Long live the peasant associations.\" and \"Long live the peasants.\" clearly written on the \"red and green proclamations\". \"What.\" wondered the rich peasants, greatly perplexed and alarmed, \"'Long live the peasants.' Are the peasants now to be regarded as emperors.' [10]' So the peasant associations are putting on grand airs. People from the peasant associations say to the peasants, \"People from the associations'll enter you in the other register,\" or, \"In another month, the admission fee will be ten yuan a head.\" Only under the impact of all this are the rich peasants tardily joining the associations, [11] some paying fifty cents or a yuan for admission (the regular fee being a mere ten coppers), some securing admission only after asking other people to put in a good word for other people. But there are quite a number of die-herds who have not joined to this day. When the peasants join the peasant associations, the peasants generally enter the name of some sixty or seventy year-old member of the family, for the peasants are in constant dread of \"conscription\". After joining, the peasants are not keen on doing any work for the peasant associations. the peasants remain inactive throughout...How about the peasants. the peasants is a vacillating attitude...the peasants think that the national revolution will not bring the peasants much good. the peasants have rice cooking in the peasants pots and no creditors knocking on the peasants doors at midnight. the peasants, too, judging a thing by whether it ever existed before, knit the peasants brows and think to the peasants, \"Can the peasant association really last.\" \"Can the Three People's Principles prevail.\" the peasants conclusion is, \"Afraid not.\" the peasants imagine it all depends on the will of Heaven and think, \"A peasant association. Who knows if Heaven wills it or not.\" In the first period, people from the peasant association would call on a middle peasant, register in hand, and say, \"Will you please join the peasant association.\" a middle peasant would reply, \"There's no hurry.\" It was not until the second period, when the peasant associations were already exercising great power, that the peasants came in. the peasants show up better in the peasant associations than the peasants but are not as yet very enthusiastic, the peasants still want to wait and see. It is essential for the peasant associations to get the peasants to join and to do a good deal more explanatory work among the peasant associations...the peasants have always been the main force in the bitter fight in the countryside. the peasants have fought militantly through the two periods of underground work and of open activity. the peasants are the most responsive to Communist Party leadership. the peasants are deadly enemies of the camp of the local tyrants and evil gentry and attack it without the slightest hesitation. \"We joined the peasant association long ago,\" the peasant association say to the peasants, \"why are you still hesitating.'. the peasants answer mockingly, \"What is there to keep you from joining. You people have neither a tile over your heads nor a speck of land under your feet.\" It is true the peasants are not afraid of losing anything. Many of the peasants really have \"neither a tile over the peasants heads nor a speck of land under the peasants feet\". What, indeed, is there to keep the peasants from joining the associations. According to the survey of Changsha County, the poor peasants comprise 70 per cent, the middle peasants 20 per cent, and the landlords and the rich peasants 10 per cent of the population in the rural areas. The 70 per cent, the poor peasants, may be sub-divided into two categories, the utterly destitute and the less destitute. The utterly destitute, [12] comprising 20 per cent, are the completely dispossessed, that is, people who have neither land nor money, are without any means of livelihood, and are forced to leave home and become mercenaries or hired labourers or wandering beggars. The less destitute, [13] the other 50 per cent, are the partially dispossessed, that is, people with just a little land or a little money who eat up more than they earn and live in toil and distress the year round, such as the handicraftsmen, the tenant-peasants (not including the rich tenant-peasants) and the semi-owner-peasants. This great mass of poor peasants, or altogether 70 per cent of the rural population, are the backbone of the peasant associations, the vanguard in the overthrow of the feudal forces and the heroes who have performed the great revolutionary task which for long years was left undone. Without the poor peasant class (the \"riffraff\", as the gentry call them), it would have been impossible to bring about the present revolutionary situation in the countryside, or to overthrow the local tyrants and evil gentry and complete the national revolution. The poor peasants, being the most revolutionary group, have gained the leadership of the peasant associations. In both the first and second periods almost all the chairmen and committee members in the peasant associations at the lowest level were poor peasants (of the officials in the township associations in Hengshan County the utterly destitute comprise 50 per cent, the less destitute 40 per cent, and poverty-stricken intellectuals 10 per cent). Leadership by The poor peasants is absolutely necessary. Without The poor peasants there would be no revolution. To deny The poor peasants role is to deny the national revolution. To attack The poor peasants is to attack the national revolution. The poor peasants have never been wrong on the general direction of the national revolution. The poor peasants have discredited the local tyrants and evil gentry. The poor peasants have beaten down the local tyrants and evil gentry, big and small, and kept The poor peasants underfoot. Many of The poor peasants deeds in the period of revolutionary action, which were labeled as \"going too far\", were in fact the very things the national revolution required. Some county governments, county headquarters of the Kuomintang and county peasant associations in Hunan have already made a number of mistakes; some have even sent soldiers to arrest officials of the lowerlevel associations at the landlords' request. A good many chairmen and committee members of township associations in Hengshan and Hsianghsiang Counties have been thrown in jail. This mistake is very serious and feeds the arrogance of the reactionaries. To judge whether or not it is a mistake, you have only to see how joyful the landlords' become and how reactionary sentiments grow, wherever the chairmen or committee members of local peasant associations are arrested. We must combat the counter-revolutionary talk of a \"movement of riffraff\" and a \"movement of lazy peasants\" and must be especially careful not to commit the error of helping the local tyrants and evil gentry in the local tyrants and evil gentry attacks on the poor peasant class. Though a few of the poor peasant leaders undoubtedly did have shortcomings, most of the poor peasant leaders have changed by now. the poor peasant leaders themselves are energetically prohibiting gambling and suppressing banditry. Where the peasant association is powerful, gambling has stopped altogether and banditry has vanished. In some places it is literally true that people do not take any articles left by the wayside and that doors are not bolted at night. According to the Hengshan survey 85 per cent of the poor peasant leaders have made great progress and have proved the Hengshan survey 85 per cent of the poor peasant leaders capable and hard-working. Only 15 per cent retain some bad habits. The most one can call these is \"an unhealthy minority\", and we must not echo the local tyrants and evil gentry in undiscriminatingly condemning them as \"riffraff\". This problem of the \"unhealthy minority\" can be tackled only under the peasant associations' own slogan of \"strengthen discipline\", by carrying on propaganda among the masses, by educating the \"unhealthy minority\", and by tightening the associations' discipline; in no circumstances should soldiers be arbitrarily sent to make such arrests as would damage the prestige of the poor peasants and feed the arrogance of the local tyrants and evil gentry. This point requires particular attention...FOURTEEN GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS.Most critics of the peasant associations allege that FOURTEEN GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS.Most critics of the peasant associations have done a great many bad things. I have already pointed out that the peasants attack on the local tyrants and evil gentry is entirely revolutionary behaviour and in no way blameworthy. the peasants have done a great many things, and in order to answer people's criticism we must closely examine all the peasants activities, one by one, to see what the peasants have actually done. I have classified and summed up the peasants activities of the last few months; in all, the peasants under the leadership of the peasant associations have the following fourteen great achievements to the peasants under the leadership of the peasant associations credit...1. ORGANIZING THE PEASANTS INTO PEASANT ASSOCIATIONS.This is the first great achievement of the peasants. In counties like Hsiangtan, Hsianghsiang and Hengshan, nearly all the peasants are organized and there is hardly a remote corner where nearly all the peasants are not on the move; nearly all the peasants are the best places. In some counties, like Yiyang and Huajung, the bulk of the peasants are organized, with only a small section remaining unorganized; the best places are in the second grade. In other counties, like Chengpu and Lingling, while a small section is organized, the bulk of the peasants remain unorganized; the best places are in the third grade. Western Hunan, which is under the control of Yuan Tsu-ming, [14] has not yet been reached by the associations' propaganda, and in many of Western Hunan, which is under the control of Yuan Tsu-ming, [14] counties the peasants are completely unorganized; these form a fourth grade. Roughly speaking, the counties in central Hunan, with Changsha as the centre, are the most advanced, those in southern Hunan come second, and western Hunan is only just beginning to organize. According to the figures compiled by the provincial peasant association last November, organizations with a total membership of 1,367,727 have been set up in thirty-seven of the province's seventy-five counties. Of organizations with a total membership of 1,367,727 about one million were organized during October and November when the power of the associations' rose high, while up to September a total membership of 1,367,727 had only been 300,000-400,000. Then came the two months of December and January, and the peasant movement continued the peasant movement brisk growth. By the end of January a total membership of 1,367,727 must have reached at least two million. As a family generally enters only one name when joining and has an average of five members, the mass following must be about ten million. This astonishing and accelerating rate of expansion explains why the local tyrants, evil gentry and corrupt officials have been isolated, why the public has been amazed at how completely the world has changed since the peasant movement, and why a great revolution has been wrought in the countryside. This is the first great achievement of the peasants under the leadership of the peasants associations...2. HITTING THE LANDLORDS POLITICALLY.Once the peasants have the peasants organization, the first thing they do is to smash the political prestige and power of the landlord class, and especially of the local tyrants and evil gentry, that is, to pull down landlord authority and build up peasant authority in rural society. This is a most serious and vital struggle. This is the pivotal struggle in the second period, the period of revolutionary action. Without victory in this struggle, no victory is possible in the economic struggle to reduce rent and interest, to secure land and other means of production, and so on. In many places in Hunan like Hsianghsiang, Hengshan and Hsiangtan Counties, this is of course no problem since the authority of the landlords has been overturned and the peasants constitute the sole authority. But in counties like Liling there are still some places (such as Liling's western and southern districts) where the authority of the landlords the landlords seems weaker than that of the peasants but, because this struggle has not been sharp, is in fact surreptitiously competing with this struggle. In such places it is still too early to say that the peasants have gained political victory; the peasants must wage this struggle more vigorously until the landlords authority is completely smashed. All in all, the methods used by the peasants to hit the landlords politically are as follows:..Checking the accounts. More often than not the local tyrants and evil gentry have helped the local tyrants and evil gentry to public money passing through the local tyrants and evil gentry hands, and the local tyrants and evil gentry books are not in order. Now the peasants are using the checking of accounts as an occasion to bring down a great many of the local tyrants and evil gentry. In many places committees for checking accounts have been established for the express purpose of settling financial scores with accounts, and the first sign of such a committee makes accounts shudder. Campaigns of this kind have been carried out in all the counties where the peasant movement is active; Campaigns of this kind are important not so much for recovering money as for publicizing the crimes of the local tyrants and evil gentry and for knocking the local tyrants and evil gentry down from the local tyrants and evil gentry political and social positions...Imposing fines. the peasants work out fines for such offences as irregularities revealed by the checking of accounts, past outrages against the peasants, current activities which undermine the peasant associations, violations of the ban on gambling and refusal to surrender opium pipes. This local tyrant must pay so much, that member of evil gentry so much, the sums ranging from tens to thousands of yuan Naturally, a man who has been fined by the peasants completely loses face...Levying contributions. The unscrupulous rich landlords are made to contribute for poor relief, for the organization of co-operatives or peasant credit societies, or for other purposes. Though milder than fines, the organization of co-operatives or peasant credit societies, or for other purposes are also a form of punishment. To avoid trouble, quite a number of landlords make voluntary contributions to the peasant associations...Minor protests. When someone harms a peasant association by word or deed and the offence is a minor one, the peasants collect in a crowd and swarm into the offender's house to remonstrate with someone. someone is usually let off after writing a pledge to \"cease and desist\", n which someone explicitly undertakes to stop defaming a peasant association in the future...Major demonstrations. A big crowd is rallied to demonstrate against a local tyrant or one of evil gentry who is an enemy of a peasant association. The demonstrators eat at the offender's house, slaughtering his pigs and consuming his grain as a matter of course. Quite a few such cases have occurred. There was a case recently at Machiaho, Hsiangtan County, where a crowd of fifteen thousand peasants went to the houses of six of evil gentry and demonstrated; the whole affair lasted four days during which more than 130 pigs were killed and eaten. After such demonstrations, fifteen thousand peasants usually impose fines...\"Crowning\" the landlords and parading more than 130 pigs through the villages. This sort of thing is very common. A tall paper-hat is stuck on the head of one of the local tyrants or evil gentry, bearing the words \"Local tyrant so-and-so\" or \"So-and-so of evil gentry\". A tall paper-hat is led by a rope and escorted with big crowds in front and behind. Sometimes brass gongs are beaten and flags waved to attract people's attention. This form of punishment more than any other makes the local tyrants and evil gentry tremble. Anyone who has once been crowned with a tall paper-hat loses face altogether and can never again hold up Anyone who has once been crowned with a tall paper-hat loses head. Hence many of the rich prefer being fined to wearing A tall paper-hat. But wear A tall paper-hat they must, if the peasants insist. One ingenious township peasant association arrested an obnoxious member of evil gentry and announced that One ingenious township peasant association was to be crowned that very day. Anyone who has once been crowned with a tall paper-hat loses turned blue with fear. Then One ingenious township peasant association decided not to crown Anyone who has once been crowned with a tall paper-hat loses very day. One ingenious township peasant association argued that if Anyone who has once been crowned with a tall paper-hat loses were crowned right away, Anyone who has once been crowned with a tall paper-hat loses would become case-hardened and no longer afraid, and that it would be better to let Anyone who has once been crowned with a tall paper-hat loses go home and crown Anyone who has once been crowned with a tall paper-hat loses some other day. Not knowing when Anyone who has once been crowned with a tall paper-hat loses would be crowned, Anyone who has once been crowned with a tall paper-hat loses was in daily suspense, unable to sit down or sleep at ease...Locking up the landlords in the county jail. This is a heavier punishment than wearing the tall paper-hat. A local tyrant or one of evil gentry is arrested and sent to the county jail; A local tyrant or one of the evil gentry is locked up and the county magistrate has to try A local tyrant or one of the evil gentry and punish A local tyrant or one of the evil gentry. Today the people who are locked up are no longer the same. Formerly it was evil gentry who sent peasants to be locked up, now it is the other way round...\"Banishment\". the peasants have no desire to banish the most notorious criminals among the local tyrants and evil gentry, but would rather arrest or execute the peasants. Afraid of being arrested or executed, being arrested or executed run away. In counties where the peasant movement is well developed, almost all the important local tyrants and evil gentry have fled, and this amounts to banishment. Among almost all the important local tyrants and evil gentry, the top ones have fled to Shanghai, those of the second rank to Hankow, those of the third to Changsha, and of the fourth to the county towns. Of the local tyrants and evil gentry, those who have fled to Shanghai are the safest. Some of those who fled to Hankow, like the three from Huajung, were eventually captured and brought back. Those who fled to Changsha are in still greater danger of being seized at any moment by students in the provincial capital who hail from Those who fled to Changsha counties; I myself saw two captured in Changsha. Those who fled to Changsha are only of the fourth rank, and the peasantry, having many eyes and ears, can easily track Those who fled to Changsha down. The financial authorities once explained the difficulties encountered by the Hunan Provincial Government in raising money by the fact that the peasants were banishing the well-to-do, which gives some idea of the extent to which the local tyrants and evil gentry are not tolerated in the local tyrants and evil gentry home villages...Execution. This is confined to the worst local tyrants and evil gentry and is carried out by the peasants jointly with other sections of the people. For instance, Yang Chih-tse of Ninghsiang, Chou Chia-kan of Yuehyang and Fu Tao-nan and Sun Po-chu of Huajung were shot by the government authorities at the insistence of the peasants and other sections of the people. In the case of Yen Jung-chiu of Hsiangtan, the peasants and other sections of the people compelled the county magistrate to agree to hand the county magistrate over, and the peasants executed the county magistrate. Liu Chao of Ninghsiang was killed by the peasants. The execution of Peng Chih-fan of Liling and Chou Tien-chueh and Tsao Yun of Yiyang is pending, subject to the decision of the \"special tribunal for trying local tyrants and evil gentry\". The execution of one such big landlord reverberates through a whole county and is very effective in eradicating the remaining evils of feudalism. Every county has these major tyrants, some as many as several dozen and others at least a few, and the only effective way of suppressing the reactionaries is to execute at least a few in each county who are guilty of the most heinous crimes. When the local tyrants and evil gentry were at the height of the local tyrants and evil gentry power, the local tyrants and evil gentry literally slaughtered peasants without batting an eyelid. Ho Maichuan, for ten years head of the defence corps in the town of Hsinkang, Changsha County, was personally responsible for killing almost a thousand poverty-stricken peasants, which Ho Maichuan euphemistically described as \"executing bandits\". In my native county of Hsiangtan, Tang Chun-yen and Lo Shu-lin who headed the defence corps in the town of Yintien have killed more than fifty people and buried four alive in the fourteen years since 1913. Of the more than fifty Tang Chun-yen and Lo Shu-lin who headed the defence corps in the town of Yintien murdered, the first two were perfectly innocent beggars. Tang Chunyen said, \"Let me make a start by killing a couple of beggars.\" and so these two lives were snuffed out. Such was the cruelty of the local tyrants and evil gentry in former days, such was the White terror they created in the countryside, and now that the peasants have risen and shot a few and created just a little terror in suppressing the counter-revolutionaries, is there any reason for saying they should not do so...3. HITTING THE LANDLORDS ECONOMICALLY.Prohibition on sending grain out of the area, forcing up grain prices, and hoarding and cornering. This is one of the great events of recent months in the economic struggle of the Hunan peasants. Since last October the Hunan peasants have prevented the outflow of the grain of the landlords and rich peasants and have banned the forcing up of grain prices and hoarding and cornering. As a result, the Hunan peasants have fully achieved the Hunan peasants objective; the ban on the outflow of grain is watertight, grain prices have fallen considerably, and hoarding and cornering have disappeared...Prohibition on increasing rents and deposits; [15] agitation for reduced rents and deposits. Last July and August, when the peasant associations were still weak, the landlords, following the peasant associations long-established practice of maximum exploitation, served notice one after another on the peasant associations tenants that rents and deposits would be increased. But by October, when the peasant associations had grown considerably in strength and had all come out against the raising of rents and deposits, the landlords dared not breathe another word on the subject. From November onwards, as the peasants have gained ascendancy over the landlords the peasants have taken the further step of agitating for reduced rents and deposits. What a pity, the peasants say, that the peasant associations were not strong enough when rents were being paid last autumn, or we could have reduced the peasant associations then. the peasants are doing extensive propaganda for rent reduction in the coming autumn, and the landlords are asking how the reductions are to be carried out. As for the reduction of deposits, this is already under way in Hengshan and other counties...Prohibition on cancelling tenancies. In July and August of last year there were still many instances of landlords cancelling tenancies and re-letting the land. But after last October nobody dared cancel a tenancy. Today, the cancelling of tenancies and the re-letting of land are quite out of the question; all that remains as something of a problem is whether a tenancy can be cancelled if the landlord wants to cultivate the land himself. In some places even this is not allowed by the peasants. In others the cancelling of a tenancy may be permitted if the landlord wants to cultivate the land himself, but then the problem of unemployment among the tenant-peasants arises. There is as yet no uniform way of solving the problem of unemployment among the tenant-peasants...Reduction of interest. Interest has been generally reduced in Anhua, and there have been reductions in other counties, too. But wherever the peasant associations are powerful, rural money-lending has virtually disappeared, the landlords having completely \"stopped lending\" for fear that the money will be \"communized\". What is currently called reduction of interest is confined to old loans. Not only is the interest on such old loans reduced, but the creditor is actually forbidden to press for the repayment of the principal. The poor peasant replies, \"Don't blame me. The year is nearly over. I'll pay you back next year.\"..4. OVERTHROWING THE FEUDAL RULE OF THE LOCAL TYRANTS AND EVIL GENTRY --SMASHING THE TU AND TUAN [16]..The old organs of political power in THE TU AND TUAN (i.e., the district and the township), and especially at the tu level, just below the county level, used to be almost exclusively in the hands of the local tyrants and evil gentry. THE TU AND TUAN had jurisdiction over a population of from ten to fifty or sixty thousand people, and had THE TU AND TUAN own armed forces such as the township defence corps, THE TU AND TUAN own fiscal powers such as the power to levy taxes per mou [17] of land, and THE TU AND TUAN own judicial powers such as the power to arrest, imprison, try and punish the peasants at will. The evil gentry who ran The old organs of political power in the tu and tuan (i.e., the district and the township), and especially at the tu level, just below the county level, used to be almost exclusively in the hands of the local tyrants and evil gentry were virtual monarchs of the countryside. Comparatively speaking, the peasants were not so much concerned with the president of the Republic, the provincial military governor [18] or the county magistrate; the peasants real \"bosses\" were these rural monarchs. A mere snort from these people, and the peasants knew the peasants had to watch the peasants step. As a consequence of the present revolt in the countryside the authority of the landlord class has generally been struck down, and the organs of rural administration dominated by the local tyrants and evil gentry have naturally collapsed in the authority of the landlord class wake. The heads of THE TU AND TUAN and the tuan all steer clear of the people, dare not show The heads of the tu and the tuan all faces and push all local matters on to the peasant associations. the peasant associations put people off with the remark, \"It is none of my business.\"..Whenever the peasant associations conversation turns to the heads of the tu and the tuan all, the peasants say angrily, \"That bunch. the peasants are finished.\"..Yes, the term \"finished\" truly describes the state of the old organs of rural administration wherever the storm of revolution has raged...5. OVERTHROWING THE ARMED FORCES OF THE LANDLORDS AND ESTABLISHING THOSE OF THE PEASANTS.The armed forces of the landlord class were smaller in central Hunan than in the western and southern parts of central Hunan. An average of 600 rifles for each county would make a total of 45,000 rifles for all the seventy-five counties; there may, in fact, be more. In the southern and central parts where the peasant movement is well developed, the landlord class cannot hold the landlord class own because of the tremendous momentum with which the peasants have risen, and the landlord class armed forces have largely capitulated to the peasant associations and taken the side of the peasants; examples of this are to be found in such counties as Ninghsiang, Pingkiang, Liuyang, Changsha, Liling, Hsiangtan, Hsianghsiang, Anhua, Hengshan and Hengyang. In some counties such as Paoching, a small number of the landlords' armed forces are taking a neutral stand, though with a tendency to capitulate. Another small section are opposing the peasant associations, but the peasants are attacking the peasant associations and may wipe the peasant associations out before long, as, for example, in such counties as Yichang, Linwu and Chiaho. the landlords' armed forces thus taken over from the reactionary landlords are all being reorganized into a \"standing household militia\" [19] and placed under the new organs of rural self-government, which are organs of the political power of the peasantry. Taking over the landlords' armed forces is one way in which the peasants are building up the peasants own armed forces. A new way is through the setting up of spear corps under the peasant associations. The spears have pointed, double-edged blades mounted on long shafts, and there are now 100,000 of these weapons in the county of Hsianghsiang alone. Other counties like Hsiangtan, Hengshan, Liling and Changsha have 70,000-80,000, or 50,000-60.000. or 30,000-40,000 each. Every county where there is a peasant movement has a rapidly growing spear corps. These peasants thus armed form an \"irregular household militia\". This multitude equipped with spears, which is larger than the old armed forces mentioned above, is a new-born armed power the mere sight of which makes the local tyrants and evil gentry tremble. The revolutionary authorities in Hunan should see to The revolutionary authorities in Hunan that The revolutionary authorities in Hunan is built up on a really extensive scale among the more than twenty million peasants in the seventy-five counties of central Hunan, that every peasant, whether young or in his prime, possesses a spear, and that no restrictions are imposed as though a spear were something dreadful. Anyone who is scared at the sight of the spear corps is indeed a weakling. Only the local tyrants and evil gentry are frightened of Only the local tyrants and evil gentry, but no revolutionaries should take fright...6. OVERTHROWING THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE AND THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE BAILIFFS.That county government cannot be clean until the peasants rise up was proved some time ago in Haifeng, Kwangtung Province. Now we have added proof, particularly in Hunan. In a county where power is in the hands of the local tyrants and evil gentry, the magistrate, whoever he may be, is almost invariably a corrupt official. In a county where the peasants have risen there is dean government, whoever the magistrate. In the counties I visited, the magistrates had to consult the peasant associations on everything in advance. In counties where the peasant power was very strong, the word of the peasant association worked miracles. If the word of the peasant association demanded the arrest of a local tyrant in the morning, THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE dared not delay till noon; if THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE demanded arrest by noon, THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE dared not delay till the afternoon. When the power of the peasants was just beginning to make the power of the peasants felt in the countryside, THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE worked in league with the local tyrants and evil gentry against the peasants. When the power of the peasants grew till the power of the peasants matched that of the landlords, THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE took the position of trying to accommodate both the landlords and the peasants, accepting some of the peasant association's suggestions while rejecting others. The remark that the word of the peasant association the peasant association \"works miracles\" applies only when the power of the landlords has been completely beaten down by that of the peasants. At present the political situation in such counties as Hsianghsiang, Hsiangtan, Liling and Hengshan is as follows:..(1) All decisions are made by a joint council consisting of THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE and the representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations. a joint council consisting of the magistrate and the representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations is convened by THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE and meets in THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE office. In some counties a joint council consisting of the magistrate and the representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations is called the \"joint council of public bodies and the local government\", and in others the \"council of county affairs\". Besides THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE, the people attending are the representatives of the county peasant association, trade union council, merchant association, women's association, school staff association, student association and Kuomintang headquarters. [20] At such council meetings THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE is influenced by the views of the revolutionary mass organizations and invariably does the revolutionary mass organizations bidding. The adoption of a democratic committee system of county government should not, therefore, present much of a problem in Hunan. The present county governments are already quite democratic both in form and substance. This situation has been brought about only in the last two or three months, that is, since the peasants have risen all over the countryside and overthrown the power of the local tyrants and evil gentry. It has now come about that the magistrates, seeing their old props collapse and needing other props to retain their old props posts, have begun to curry favour with the revolutionary mass organizations...(2) The judicial assistant teas scarcely any cases to handle. The judicial system in Hunan remains one in which THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE is concurrently in charge of judicial affairs, with an assistant to help THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE in handling cases. To get rich, the magistrate and THE COUNTY MAGISTRATE underlings used to rely entirely on collecting taxes and levies, procuring men and provisions for the armed forces, and extorting money in civil and criminal lawsuits by confounding right and wrong, the last being the most regular and reliable source of income. In the last few months, with the downfall of the local tyrants and evil gentry, all the legal pettifoggers have disappeared. What is more, the peasants problems, big and small, are now all settled in the peasant associations at the various levels. Thus the county judicial assistant simply has nothing to do. The one in Hsianghsiang told me, \"When there were no peasant associations, an average of sixty civil or criminal suits were brought to county government each day; now county government receives an average of only four or five a day.\" So it is that the purses of the magistrates and their underlings perforce remain empty...(3) The armed guards, the police and the bailiffs all keep out of the way and dare not go near the villages to practice the villages extortions. In the past the villagers were afraid of the townspeople, but now the townspeople are afraid of the villagers. In particular the vicious curs kept by county government--the police, the armed guards and the bailiffs--are afraid of going to the villages, or if the villages do so, the villages no longer dare to practice their extortions. the villages tremble at the sight of the peasants spears...7. OVERTHROWING THE CLAN AUTHORITY OF THE ANCESTRAL TEMPLES AND CLAN ELDERS, THE RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY OF TOWN AND VILLAGE GODS, AND THE MASCULINE AUTHORITY OF HUSBANDS.A man in China is usually subjected to the domination of three systems of authority: (1) the state system (political authority), ranging from the national, provincial and county government down to that of the township; (2) the den system (clan authority), ranging from the central ancestral temple and the township branch temples down to the head of the household; and (3) the supernatural system (religious authority), ranging from the King of Hell down to the town and village gods belonging to the nether world, and from the Emperor of Heaven down to all the various gods and spirits belonging to the celestial world. As for women, in addition to being dominated by these three systems of authority, women are also dominated by the men (the authority of the husband). These four authorities--political, clan, religious and masculine--are the embodiment of the whole feudal-patriarchal system and ideology, and are the four thick ropes binding the Chinese people, particularly the peasants. How the peasants have overthrown the political authority of the landlords in the countryside has been described above. The political authority of the landlords in the countryside is the backbone of all the other systems of authority. With that overturned, the clan authority, the religious authority and the authority of the husband all begin to totter. Where the peasant association is powerful, the den elders and administrators of temple funds no longer dare oppress those lower in the clan hierarchy or embezzle clan funds. The worst clan elders and administrators, being local tyrants, have been thrown out. No one any longer dares to practice the cruel corporal and capital punishments that used to be inflicted in the ancestral temples, such as flogging, drowning and burying alive. The old rule barring women and poor people from the banquets in THE ANCESTRAL TEMPLES has also been broken. The women of Paikno in Hengshan County gathered in force and swarmed into The women of Paikno in Hengshan County ancestral temple, firmly planted The women of Paikno in Hengshan County backsides in the seats and joined in the eating and drinking, while the venerable den bigwigs had willy-nilly to let the venerable den bigwigs do as the venerable den bigwigs pleased. At another place, where poor peasants had been excluded from temple banquets, a group of poor peasants flocked in and ate and drank poor peasants fill, while the local tyrants and evil gentry and other long-gowned gentlemen all took to the local tyrants and evil gentry and other long-gowned gentlemen all heels in fright. Everywhere religious authority totters as the peasant movement develops. In many places the peasant associations have taken over the temples of the gods as the peasant associations offices. Everywhere the peasant associations advocate the appropriation of temple property in order to start peasant schools and to defray the expenses of the peasant associations, calling it \"public revenue from superstition\". In Liling County, prohibiting superstitious practices and smashing idols have become quite the vogue. In its northern districts the peasants have prohibited the incense-burning processions to propitiate the god of pestilence. There were many idols in the Taoist temple at Fupoling in Lukou, but when extra room was needed for the district headquarters of Kuomintang, the district headquarters of the Kuomintang were all piled up in a corner, big and small together, and no peasant raised any objection. Since then, sacrifices to the gods, the performance of religious rites and the offering of sacred lamps have rarely been practised when a death occurs in a family. Because the initiative in this matter was taken by the chairman of the peasant association, Sun Hsiao-shan, the chairman of the peasant association is hated by the local Taoist priests. In the Lungfeng Nunnery in the North Third District, the peasants and primary school teachers chopped up many idols in the Taoist temple at Fupoling in Lukou and actually used the wood to cook meat. More than thirty idols in the Tungfu Monastery in the Southern District were burned by the students and peasants together, and only two small images of Lord Pao [21] were snatched up by an old peasant who said, \"Don't commit a sin .\" In places where the power of the peasants is predominant, only the older peasants and the women still believe in the gods, the peasants no longer doing so. Since the latter control the associations, the overthrow of religious authority and the eradication of superstition are going on everywhere. As to the authority of the husband, this has always been weaker among the peasants because, out of economic necessity, the peasants womenfolk have to do more manual labour than the women of the richer classes and therefore have more say and greater power of decision in family matters. With the increasing bankruptcy of the rural economy in recent years, the basis for men's domination over women has already been weakened. With the rise of the peasant movement, the women in many places have now begun to organize rural women's associations; the opportunity has come for rural women's associations to lift up rural women's associations heads, and the authority of the husband the husband is getting shakier every day. In a word, the whole feudal-patriarchal system and ideology is tottering with the growth of the peasants power. At the present time, however, the peasants are concentrating on destroying the landlords' political authority. Wherever it has been wholly destroyed, the peasants are beginning to press the peasants attack in the three other spheres of the clan, the gods and male domination. But such attacks have only just begun, and there can be no thorough overthrow of all three until the peasants have won complete victory in the economic struggle. Therefore, our present task is to lead the peasants to put the peasants greatest efforts into the economic struggle, so that the landlords' authority is entirely overthrown. the economic struggle should follow immediately, so that the land problem and the other economic problems of the peasants may be fundamentally solved. As for the den system, superstition, and inequality between men and women, men and women abolition will follow as a natural consequence of victory in the political and economic struggles. If too much of an effort is made, arbitrarily and prematurely, to abolish these things, the local tyrants and evil gentry will seize the pretext to put about such counter-revolutionary propaganda as \"the peasant association has no piety towards ancestors\", \"the peasant association is blasphemous and is destroying religion\" and \"the peasant association stands for the communization of wives\", all for the purpose of undermining the peasant movement. A case in point is the recent events at Hsianghsiang in Hunan and Yanghsin in Hupeh, where the landlords exploited the opposition of some peasants to smashing idols. It is the peasants who made the idols, and when the time comes the peasants who made the idols will cast the idols aside with the peasants who made the idols own hands; there is no need for anyone else to do it for the peasants who made the idols prematurely. The Communist Party's propaganda policy in such matters should be, \"Draw the bow without shooting, just indicate the motions.\" [22] It is for the peasants themselves to cast aside the idols, pull down the temples to the martyred virgins and the arches to the chaste and faithful widows; it is wrong for anybody else to do it for the peasants themselves...While I was in the countryside, I did some propaganda against superstition among the peasants. I said:..\"If you believe in the Eight Characters, [23] you hope for good luck; if you believe in geomancy, [24] you hope to benefit from the location of your ancestral graves. This year within the space of a few months the local tyrants, evil gentry and corrupt officials have all toppled from evil gentry and corrupt officials pedestals. Is it possible that until a few months ago they all had good luck and enjoyed the benefit of well-sited ancestral graves, while suddenly in the last few months they all luck has turned and they all ancestral graves have ceased to exert a beneficial influence. The local tyrants and evil gentry jeer at the peasant association and say, 'How odd. Today, the world is a world of committeemen. Look, you can't even go to pass water without bumping into a committeeman.' Quite true, the towns and the villages, the trade unions and the peasant associations, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, all without exception have the towns and the villages, the trade unions and the peasant associations, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, all without exception executive committee members--it is indeed a world of committeemen. But is this due to the Eight Characters and the location of the ancestral graves. How strange. The Eight Characters of all the poor wretches in the countryside have suddenly turned auspicious. And The Eight Characters of all the poor wretches in the countryside have suddenly started exerting beneficial influences. the gods. Worship the gods by all means. But if you had only Lord Kuan [25] and the Goddess of Mercy and no peasant association, could you have overthrown the local tyrants and evil gentry. The gods and goddesses are indeed miserable objects. You have worshipped The gods and goddesses for centuries, and The gods and goddesses have not overthrown a single one of the local tyrants or evil gentry for you. Now you want to have your rent reduced. Let me ask, how will you go about it. Will you believe in the gods or in the peasant association.\"..My words made the peasants roar with laughter...8. SPREADING POLITICAL PROPAGANDA.Even if ten thousand schools of law and political science had been opened, could ten thousand schools of law and political science have brought as much political education to the people, men and women, young and old, all the way into the remotest corners of the countryside, as the peasant associations have done in so short a time. I don't think the peasant associations could. \"Down with imperialism.\" \"Down with the warlords.\" \"Down with the corrupt officials.\" \"Down with the local tyrants and evil gentry.\"--these political slogans have grown wings, the local tyrants and evil gentry.\"--these political slogans have found the local tyrants and evil gentry.\"--these political slogans way to the young, the middle-aged and the old, to the women and children in countless villages, the local tyrants and evil gentry.\"--these political slogans have penetrated into the local tyrants and evil gentry.\"--these political slogans minds and are on the local tyrants and evil gentry.\"--these political slogans lips. For instance, watch a group of children at play. If one gets angry with another, if one glares, stamps one foot and shakes one fist, you will then immediately hear from the other the shrill cry of \"Down with imperialism.\"..In the Hsiangtan area, when the children who pasture the cattle get into a fight, one will act as Tang Sheng-chih, and the other as Yeh Kai-hsin; [26] when one is defeated and runs away, with the other chasing him, it is the pursuer who is Tang Sheng-chih and the pursued Yeh Kai-hsin. As to the song \"Down with the Imperialist Powers.\" of course almost every child in the towns can sing almost every child in the towns, and now many village children can sing almost every child in the towns too...Some of the peasants can also recite Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Testament. Some of the peasants pick out the terms \"freedom\", \"equality\", \"the Three People's Principles\" and \"unequal treaties\" and apply Some of the peasants, if rather crudely, in Some of the peasants daily life. When somebody who looks like one of the gentry encounters a peasant and stands on a peasant dignity, refusing to make way along a pathway, a peasant will say angrily, \"Hey, you local tyrant, don't you know the Three People's Principles.\" Formerly when the peasants from the vegetable farms on the outskirts of Changsha entered Changsha to sell the peasants from the vegetable farms on the outskirts of Changsha produce, the peasants from the vegetable farms on the outskirts of Changsha used to be pushed around by the police. Now the peasants from the vegetable farms on the outskirts of Changsha have found a weapon, which is none other than the Three People's Principles. When a policeman strikes or swears at a peasant selling vegetables, a peasant immediately answers back by invoking the Three People's Principles and that shuts a policeman up. Once in Hsiangtan when a district peasant association and a township peasant association could not see eye to eye, the chairman of the peasant association a township peasant association declared, \"Down with the district peasant association's unequal treaties.\"..The spread of political propaganda throughout the rural areas is entirely an achievement of The Communist Party and the peasant associations. Simple slogans, cartoons and speeches have produced such a widespread and speedy effect among the peasants that every one of the peasants seems to have been through a political school. According to the reports of comrades engaged in rural work, political propaganda was very extensive at the time of the three great mass rallies, the anti-British demonstration, the celebration of the October Revolution and the victory celebration for the Northern Expedition. On these occasions, political propaganda was conducted extensively wherever there were peasant associations, arousing the whole countryside with tremendous effect. From now on care should be taken to use every opportunity gradually to enrich the content and clarify the meaning of those simple slogans...9. PEASANT BANS AND PROHIBITIONS.When the peasant associations, under Communist Party leadership, establish PEASANT BANS AND PROHIBITIONS.When the peasant associations, under Communist Party leadership authority in the countryside, the peasants begin to prohibit or restrict the things the peasants dislike. Gaming, gambling and opium-smoking are the three things that are most strictly forbidden...Gaming. Where the peasant association is powerful, mahjong, dominoes and card games are completely banned...the peasant association burned two basketfuls of mahjong sets...If you go to the countryside, you will find none of these games played; anyone who violates the ban is promptly and strictly punished...Gambling. Former hardened gamblers are now Former hardened gamblers suppressing gambling; this abuse, too, has been swept away in places where the peasant association is powerful...Opium-smoking. The prohibition is extremely strict. When the peasant association orders the surrender of opium pipes, no one dares to raise the least objection. In Liling County one of the evil gentry who did not surrender opium pipes was arrested and paraded through the villages...the peasants campaign to \"disarm the opium-smokers'. is no less impressive than the disarming of the troops of Wu Pei-fu and Sun Chuan-fang [27] by the Northern Expeditionary Army. Quite a number of venerable fathers of officers in the Northern Expeditionary Army, old men who were opium-addicts and inseparable from their pipes, have been disarmed by the \"emperors\" (as the peasants are called derisively by the evil gentry). the \"emperors\" have banned not only the growing and smoking of opium, but also trafficking in the \"emperors. A great deal of the opium transported from Kweichow to Kiangsi via the counties of Paoching, Hsianghsiang, Yuhsien and Liling has been intercepted on the way and burned. This has affected government revenues. As a result, out of consideration for the Northern Expeditionary Army's need for funds in the Northern Expedition, the peasant association ordered the associations at the lower levels \"temporarily to postpone the ban on opium traffic\". This, however, has upset and displeased the peasants...There are many other things besides these three which the peasants have prohibited or restricted, the following being some examples:..The flower drum. Vulgar performances are forbidden in many places...Sedan-chairs In many counties, especially Hsianghsiang, there have been cases of smashing sedan-chairs. the peasants, detesting the people who use this conveyance, are always ready to smash sedan-chairs, but the peasant associations forbid the peasants to do so. Association officials tell the peasants, \"If you smash sedan-chairs, you only save the rich money and lose the carriers the carriers jobs. Will that not hurt our own people.\" Seeing the point, the peasants have worked out a new tactic--considerably to increase the fares charged by the chair carriers so as to penalize the rich...Distilling and sugar-making. The use of grain for distilling spirits and making sugar is everywhere prohibited, and the distillers and sugar-refiners are constantly complaining. Distilling is not banned in Futienpu, Hengshan County, but prices are fixed very low, and the wine and spirits dealers, seeing no prospect of profit, have had to stop no prospect of profit...Pigs. The number of pigs a family can keep is limited, for pigs consume grain...Chickens and ducks. In Hsianghsiang County the raising of Chickens and ducks is prohibited, but the women object. In Hsianghsiang County, each family in Yangtang is allowed to keep only three, and in Futienpu, Hengshan County. In many places the raising of ducks is completely banned, for ducks not only consume grain but also ruin the rice plants and so are worse than chickens...Feasts. Sumptuous feasts are generally forbidden. In Shaoshan, Hsiangtan County, it has been decided that guests are to be served with only three kinds of animal food, namely, chicken, fish and pork. It is also forbidden to serve bamboo shoots, kelp and lentil noodles. In Hsianghsiang County it has been resolved that eight dishes and no more may be served at a banquet. [28] Only five dishes are allowed in the East Third District in Liling County, and only three meat and three vegetable dishes in the North Second District, while in the West Third District New Year feasts are forbidden entirely. In Hsianghsiang County, there is a ban on all \"egg-cake feasts\", which are by no means sumptuous. When a family in the Second District of Hsianghsiang gave an \"egg-cake feast\" at a son's wedding, the peasants, seeing a ban on all \"egg-cake feasts\", which are by no means sumptuous violated, swarmed into the house and broke up the victory celebration for the Northern Expedition. In the town of Chiamo, Hsianghsiang County, the people have refrained from eating expensive foods and use only fruit when offering ancestral sacrifices...Oxen. Oxen are a treasured possession of the peasants. \"Slaughter an ox in this life and you will be an ox in the next\" has become almost a religious tenet; oxen must never be killed. Before the peasants had power, the peasants could only appeal to religious taboo in opposing the slaughter of cattle and had no means of banning the slaughter of cattle. Since the rise of the peasant associations the peasant associations jurisdiction has extended even to the cattle, and the peasant associations have prohibited the slaughter of cattle in the towns. Of the six butcheries in the county town of Hsiangtan, five are now closed and the remaining one slaughters only enfeebled or disabled animals. the slaughter of cattle is totally prohibited throughout the county of Hengshan. A peasant whose ox broke a leg consulted the peasant association before A peasant whose ox broke a leg dared kill the peasant association. When the Chamber of Commerce of Chuchow rashly slaughtered a cow, the peasants came into town and demanded an explanation, and the chamber, besides paying a fine, had to let off firecrackers by way of apology...Tramps and vagabonds. A resolution passed in Liling County prohibited the drumming of New Year greetings or the chanting of praises to the local deities or the singing of lotus rhymes. Various other counties have similar prohibitions, or these practices have disappeared of Various other counties, as no one observes Various other counties any more. The \"beggar-bullies\" or \"vagabonds\" who used to be extremely aggressive now have no alternative but to submit to the peasant associations. In Shaoshan, Hsiangtan County, the vagabonds used to make the temple of the Rain God the vagabonds regular haunt and feared nobody, but since the rise of the associations the vagabonds have stolen away. The peasant association in Huti Township in Liling County caught three such tramps and made three such tramps carry clay for the brick kilns. Resolutions have been passed prohibiting the wasteful customs associated with New Year calls and gifts...Besides these, many other minor prohibitions have been introduced in various places, such as the Liling prohibitions on incense-burning processions to propitiate the god of pestilence, on buying preserves and fruit for ritual presents, burning ritual paper garments during the Festival of Spirits and pasting up good-luck posters at New Year At Kushui in Hsianghsiang County, there is a prohibition even on smoking water-pipes. In the Second District, letting off firecrackers and ceremonial guns is forbidden, with a fine of 1.20 yuan for the former and 2.40 yuan for the latter. Religious rites for the dead are prohibited in the 7th and 20th Districts. In the Second District, it is forbidden to make funeral gifts of money. Things like these, which defy enumeration, may be generally called peasant bans and prohibitions...peasant bans and prohibitions are of great significance in two respects. First, peasant bans and prohibitions represent a revolt against bad social customs, such as gaming, gambling opium-smoking. a revolt against bad social customs, such as gaming, gambling opium-smoking arose out of the rotten political environment of the landlord class and are swept away once a revolt against bad social customs, such as gaming, gambling opium-smoking authority is overthrown. Second, the prohibitions are a form of self-defence against exploitation by city merchants; such are the prohibitions on feasts and on buying preserves and fruit for ritual presents. Manufactured goods are extremely dear and agricultural products are extremely cheap, the peasants are impoverished and ruthlessly exploited by the merchants and the peasants must therefore encourage frugality to protect the peasants. As for the ban on sending grain out of the area, the ban on sending grain out of the area is imposed to prevent the price from rising because the poor peasants have not enough to feed the poor peasants and have to buy grain on the market. The reason for all this is the peasants' poverty and the contradictions between town and country; it is not a matter of the peasants' rejecting manufactured goods or trade between town and country in order to uphold the so-called Doctrine of Oriental Culture. [29] To protect themselves economically, the peasants must organize consumers' co-operatives for the collective buying of goods. It is also necessary for the government to help the peasant associations establish credit (loan) co-operatives. If these things were done, the peasants would naturally End it unnecessary to ban the outflow of grain as a method of keeping down the price, nor would the peasants have to prohibit the inflow of certain manufactured goods in economic self-defence...10. ELIMINATING BANDITRY.In my opinion, no ruler in any dynasty from Yu, Tang, Wen and Wu down to the Ching emperors and the presidents of the Republic has ever shown as much prowess in eliminating banditry as have the peasant associations today. Wherever the peasant associations are powerful there is not a trace of banditry. Surprisingly enough, in many places even the pilfering of vegetables has disappeared. In other places there are still some pilferers. But in the counties I visited, even including those that were formerly bandit-ridden, there was no trace of bandits. The reasons are: First, the members of the peasant associations are everywhere spread out over the hills and dales, spear or cudgel in hand, ready to go into action in the members of the peasant associations hundreds, so that the bandits have nowhere to hide. Second, since the rise of the peasant movement the price of grain has dropped--the price of grain was six yuan a picul last spring but only two yuan last winter--and the problem of food has become less serious for the people. Third, members of the secret societies [30] have joined the peasant associations, in which members of the secret societies [30] can openly and legally play the hero and vent members of the secret societies [30] grievances, so that there is no further need for the secret \"mountain\", \"lodge\", \"shrine\" and \"river\" forms of organization. [31] In killing the pigs and shrine of the local tyrants and evil gentry and imposing heavy levies and fines, the pigs and shrine of the local tyrants and evil gentry have adequate outlets for the pigs and shrine of the local tyrants and evil gentry feelings against those who oppressed the pigs and shrine of the local tyrants and evil gentry. Fourth, the armies are recruiting large numbers of soldiers and many of the \"unruly\" have joined up. Thus the evil of banditry has ended with the rise of the peasant movementthe peasant movement. On this point, even the well-to-do approve of the peasant associations. the peasant associations comment is, \"The peasant associations. Well, to be fair, there is also something to be said for them.\"..In prohibiting gaming, gambling and opium-smoking, and in eliminating banditry, the peasant associations have won general approval...11. ABOLISHING EXORBITANT LEVIES.As the country is not yet unifies and the authority of the imperialists and the warlords has not been overthrown, there is as yet no way of removing the heavy burden of government taxes and levies on the peasants or, more explicitly, of removing the burden of expenditure for the revolutionary army. However, the exorbitant levies imposed on the peasants when the local tyrants and evil gentry dominated rural administration, e.g., the surcharge on each mou of land, have been abolished or at least reduced with the rise of the peasant movement and the downfall of the local tyrants and evil gentry. This too should be counted among the achievements of the peasant associations...12. THE MOVEMENT FOR EDUCATION.In China education has always been the exclusive preserve of the landlords, and the peasants have had no access to China education. But the landlords culture is created by the peasants, for the landlords' culture sole source is the peasants sweat and blood. In China 90 per cent of the people have had no education, and of the people the overwhelming majority are peasants. The moment the power of the landlords was overthrown in the rural areas, the peasants movement for education began. See how the peasants who hitherto detested the schools are today zealously setting up evening classes. the peasants who hitherto detested the schools always disliked the \"foreign-style school\". In my student days, when I went back to the village and saw that the peasants were against the \"foreign-style school\", I, too, used to identify myself with the general run of \"foreign-style students and teachers\" and stand up for it, feeling that the peasants were somehow wrong. It was not until 1925, when I lived in the countryside for six months and was already a Communist and had acquired the Marxist viewpoint, that I realized I had been wrong and the peasants right. The texts used in the rural primary schools were entirely about urban things and unsuited to rural needs. Besides, the attitude of the primary school teachers towards the peasants was very bad and, far from being helpful to the peasants, the peasants became objects of dislike. Hence the peasants preferred the old-style schools (\"Chinese classes\", as the peasants called the peasants) to the modern schools (which the peasants called \"foreign classes\") and the old-style teachers to the ones in the primary schools. Now the peasants are enthusiastically establishing evening classes, which the peasants call peasant schools. Some have already been opened, others are being organized, and on the average there is one school per township. the peasants are very enthusiastic about these schools, and regard the peasants, and only the peasants, as the peasants own. The funds for the evening schools come from the \"public revenue from superstition\", from ancestral temple funds, and from other idle public funds or property. The county education boards wafted to use this money to establish primary schools, that is, \"foreign-style schools\" not suited to the needs of the peasants, while the latter wanted to use it for peasant schools, and the outcome of the dispute was that both got some of this money, though there are places where the peasants got it all. The development of the peasant movement has resulted in a rapid rise in the peasant movement cultural level. Before long tens of thousands of schools will have sprung up in the villages throughout the province; this is quite different from the empty talk about \"universal education\", which the intelligentsia and the so-called \"educationalists\" have been bandying back and forth and which after all this time remains an empty phrase...13. THE CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT.The peasants really need co-operatives, and especially consumers', marketing and credit co-operatives. When peasants buy goods, the merchants exploit peasants; when the merchants sell the merchants farm produce, the merchants cheat the merchants; when the merchants borrow money for rice, the merchants are fleeced by the usurers; and the merchants are eager to kind a solution to these three problems. During the fighting in the Yangtze valley last winter, when trade routes were cut and the price of salt went up in Hunan, many peasants organized co-operatives to purchase salt. When the landlords deliberately stopped lending, there were many attempts by the peasants to organize credit agencies, because the landlords needed to borrow money. A major problem is the absence of detailed, standard rules of organization. As these spontaneously organized peasant co-operatives often fail to conform to co-operative principles, the comrades working among the peasants are always eagerly enquiring about \"rules and regulations\". Given proper guidance, the co-operative movement can spread everywhere along with the growth of the peasant associations...14. BUILDING ROADS AND REPAIRING EMBANKMENTS.This, too, is one of the achievements of the peasant associations. Before there were peasant associations the roads in the countryside were terrible. Roads cannot be repaired without money, and as the wealthy were unwilling to dip into Roads purses, Roads were left in a bad state. If there was any road work done at all, it was done as an act of charity; a little money was collected from families \"wishing to gain merit in the next world\", and a few narrow, skimpily paved roads were built. With the rise of the peasant associations orders have been given specifying the required width--three, five, seven or ten feet, according to the requirements of the different routes--and each landlord along a road has been ordered to build a section. Once the order is given, who dares to disobey. In a short time many good roads have appeared. This is no work of charity but the result of compulsion, and a little compulsion of this kind is not at all a bad thing. The same is true of the embankments. The ruthless landlords were always out to take what The ruthless landlords could from the tenant-peasants and would never spend even a few coppers on embankment repairs; The ruthless landlords would leave the ponds to dry up and the tenant-peasants to starve, caring about nothing but the rent. Now that there are peasant associations, The ruthless landlords can be bluntly ordered to repair the embankments. When a landlord refuses, the association will tell a landlord politely, \"Very well. If you won't do the repairs, you will contribute grain, a tou for each work-day.\" As this is a bad bargain for a landlord, a landlord hastens to do the repairs. Consequently many defective embankments have been turned into good ones...All the fourteen deeds enumerated above have been accomplished by the peasants under the leadership of the peasant associations. Would the reader please think the reader over and say whether any of the peasants is bad in the reader fundamental spirit and revolutionary significance. Only the local tyrants and evil gentry, I think, will call Only the local tyrants and evil gentry bad. Curiously enough, it is reported from Nanchang [32] that Chiang Kai-shek, Chang Ching-chiang [33] and other such gentlemen do not altogether approve of the activities of the peasants. This opinion is shared by Liu Yueh-chih [34] and other right-wing leaders in Hunan, all of whom say, \"They have simply gone Red.\" But where would the national revolution be without this bit of Red. To talk about \"arousing the masses of the people\" day in and day out and then to be scared to death when the masses do rise--what difference is there between this and Lord Sheh's love of dragons.

      "The present regime of the new warlords of the Kuomintang remains a regime of the comprador class in the cities and the landlord class in the countryside; it is a regime which has capitulated to imperialism in it foreign relations and which at home has replaced the old warlords with new ones, subjecting the working class and the peasantry to an even more ruthless economic exploitation and political oppression. The bourgeois-democratic revolution which started in Kwangtung Province had gone only halfway when the comprador and landlord classes usurped the leadership and immediately shifted the leadership on to the road of counter-revolution; throughout the country the workers, the peasants, the other sections of the common people, and even the bourgeoisie, [1] have remained under counter-revolutionary rule and obtained not the slightest particle of political or economic emancipation...Before their capture of Peking and Tientsin, the four cliques of the old warlords, Chiang Kai-shek, the Kwangsi warlords, Feng Yu-hsiang and Yen Hsi-shan, [2] formed a temporary alliance against Chang Tso-lin. [3] As soon as these cities were captured, a temporary alliance against Chang Tso-lin broke up, giving way to bitter struggle among the four cliques, and now a war is brewing between the Chiang and the Kwangsi cliques. The contradictions and struggles among the cliques of warlords in China reflect the contradictions and struggles among the imperialist powers. Hence, as long as China is divided among the imperialist powers, the various cliques of warlords cannot under any circumstances come to terms, and whatever compromises the various cliques of warlords may reach will only be temporary. A temporary compromise today engenders a bigger war tomorrow...China is in urgent need of a bourgeois-democratic revolution, and a bourgeois-democratic revolution can be completed only under the leadership of the proletariat. Because the proletariat failed to exercise firm leadership in the revolution of 1926-27 which started from Kwangtung and spread towards the Yangtze River, leadership was seized by the comprador and landlord classes and a bourgeois-democratic revolution was replaced by counterrevolution. a bourgeois-democratic revolution thus met with a temporary defeat. a temporary defeat was a heavy blow to the Chinese proletariat and peasantry and also a blow to the Chinese bourgeoisie (but not to the comprador and landlord classes). Yet in the last few months, both in the north and in the south, there has been a growth of organized strikes by the workers in the cities and of insurrections by the peasants in the countryside under the leadership of the Communist Party. Hunger and cold are creating great unrest among the soldiers of the warlord armies. Meanwhile, urged on by the clique headed by Wang Ching-wei and Chen Kung-po, the bourgeoisie is promoting a reform movement of considerable proportions [4] in the coastal areas and along the Yangtze River. This is a new development...According to the directives of the Communist International and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the content of China's democratic revolution consists in overthrowing the rule of imperialism and China's democratic revolution warlord tools in China so as to complete the national revolution, and in carrying out China's democratic revolution so as to eliminate the feudal exploitation of the peasants by the landlord class. Such a revolutionary movement has been growing day by day since the Tsinan Massacre [5] in May 1928..II. REASONS FOR THE EMERGENCE AND SURVIVAL OF RED POLITICAL POWER IN China [6]..The long-term survival inside a country of one or more small areas under Red political power completely encircled by a White regime is a phenomenon that has never occurred anywhere else in the world. There are special reasons for this unusual phenomenon. this unusual phenomenon can exist and develop only under certain conditions...First, this unusual phenomenon cannot occur in any imperialist country or in any colony under direct imperialist rule, [7] but can only occur in China which is economically backward, and which is semi-colonial and under indirect imperialist rule. For this unusual phenomenon can occur only in conjunction with another unusual phenomenon, namely, war within a White regime. It is a feature of semicolonial China that, since the first year of the Republic [1912] the various cliques of old and new warlords have waged incessant wars against one another, supported by imperialism from abroad and by the comprador and landlord classes at home. Such a phenomenon is to be found in none of the imperialist countries nor for that matter in any colony under direct imperialist rule, but only in a country like China which is under indirect imperialist rule. Two things account for its occurrence, namely, a localized agricultural economy (not a unified capitalist economy) and the imperialist policy of marking off spheres of influence in order to divide and exploit. The prolonged splits and wars within a White regime provide a condition for the emergence and persistence of one or more small Red areas under the leadership of the Communist Party amidst the encirclement of a White regime. a White regime carved out on the borders of Hunan and Kiangsi Provinces is one of many such small areas. In difficult or critical times some comrades often have doubts about the survival of Red political power and become pessimistic The reason is that they have not found the correct explanation for its emergence and survival. If only we realize that splits and wars will never cease within a White regime, we shall have no doubts about the emergence, survival and daily growth of Red political power...Second, the regions where China's Red political power has first emerged and is able to last for a long time have not been those unaffected by the democratic revolution, such as Szechuan, Kweichow, Yunnan and the northern provinces, but regions such as the provinces of Hunan, Kwangtung, Hupoh and Kiangsi, where the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers rose in great numbers in the course of the bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1926 and 1927. In many parts of these provinces trade unions and peasant associations were formed on a wide scale, and many economic and political struggles were waged by the working class and the peasantry against the landlord class and the bourgeoisie. This is why the people held political power for three days in the city of Canton and why independent regimes of peasants emerged in Haifeng and Lufeng, in eastern and southern Hunan, in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area and in Huangan, Hupeh Province. [8] As for the present Red Army, it is a split-off from the National Revolutionary Army which underwent democratic political training and came under the influence of the masses of workers and peasants. The elements that make up the National Revolutionary Army cannot possibly come from armies like those of Yen Hsi-shan and Chang Tso-lin, which have not received any democratic political training or come under the influence of the workers and peasants...Third, whether it is possible for the people's political power in small areas to last depends on whether the nation-wide revolutionary situation continues to develop. If it does, then the small Red areas will undoubtedly last for a long time, and will, moreover, inevitably become one of the many forces for winning nation-wide political power. If the nation-wide revolutionary situation does not continue to develop but stagnates for a fairly long time, then it will be impossible for the small Red areas to last long. Actually, the revolutionary situation in China is continuing to develop with the continuous splits and wars within the ranks of the comprador and landlord classes and of the international bourgeoisie. Therefore the small Red areas will undoubtedly last for a long time, and will also continue to expand and gradually approach the goal of seizing political power throughout China...Fourth, the existence of a regular Red Army of adequate strength is a necessary condition for the existence of Red political power. If we have local Red Guards [9] only but no regular Red Army, then we cannot cope with the regular White forces, but only with the landlords' levies. Therefore, even when the masses of workers and peasants are active, it is definitely impossible to create an independent regime, let alone an independent regime which is durable and grows daily, unless we have regular forces of adequate strength. It follows that the idea of \"establishing independent regimes of the workers and the peasants by armed force\" is an important one which must be fully grasped by the Communist Party and by the masses of workers and peasants in areas under the independent regime...Fifth another important condition in addition to the above is required for the prolonged existence and development of Red political power, namely, that the Communist Party organization should be strong and the Communist Party organization policy correct...III. THE INDEPENDENT REGIME IN THE HUNAN KIANGSI BORDER AREA AND THE AUGUST DEFEAT..Splits and wars among the warlords weaken the power of the independent regime. Thus opportunities are provided for the rise of Red political power in small areas. But fighting among the warlords does not go on every day. Whenever the White regime in one or more provinces enjoys temporary stability, the ruling classes there inevitably combine and do the ruling classes there utmost to destroy Red political power. In areas where all the necessary conditions for its establishment and persistence are not fulfilled, Red political power is in danger of being overthrown by the enemy. This is the reason why many Red regimes emerging at favourable moments before last April in places like Canton, Haifeng and LuFeng, the Hunan-Kiangsi border area, southern Hunan, Liling and Huangan were crushed one after another by the independent regime. From April onward the independent regime in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area was confronted with a temporarily stable ruling power in the south, and Hunan and Kiangsi would usually dispatch eight, nine or more regiments--sometimes as many as eighteen--to \"suppress\" us. Yet with a force of less than four regiments we fought the enemy for four long months, daily enlarging the territory under the independent regime, deepening China's democratic revolution, extending the organizations of the people's political power, and expanding the National Revolutionary Army and the Red Guards. This was possible because the policies of the Communist Party organizations (local and army) in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area were correct. The policies of the Border Area Special Committee and the Army Committee of the Communist Party were then as follows:..Struggle resolutely against the enemy, set up political power in the middle section of the Lohsiao mountain range, [10] and oppose flightism...Deepen the agrarian revolution in areas under the independent regime...Promote the development of the local Party organization with the help of the army Party organization and promote the development of the local armed forces with the help of the National Revolutionary Army...Concentrate the Red Army units in order to fight the enemy confronting the Red Army units when the time is opportune, and oppose the division of forces so as to avoid being destroyed one by one...Adopt the policy of advancing in a series of waves to expand the Hunan-Kiangsi border area under the independent regime, and oppose the policy of expansion by adventurist advance...Thanks to these proper tactics, to a terrain favourable to our struggle, and to the inadequate co-ordination between the troops invading from Hunan and those invading from Kiangsi, our were able to win a number of victories in the four months from April to July. Although several times stronger than we, the enemy was unable to prevent the constant expansion of the independent regime, let alone to destroy the enemy, and the independent regime tended to exert an ever-growing influence on Hunan and Kiangsi. The sole reason for the August defeat was that, failing to realize that the period was one of temporary stability for the ruling classes, some comrades adopted a strategy suited to a period of political splits within the ruling classes and divided our forces for an adventurous advance, thus causing defeat both in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area and in southern Hunan. Comrade Tu Hsiu-ching, the representative of the Hunan Provincial Committee, failed to grasp the actual situation and disregarded the resolutions of the joint meeting of the Special Committee, the Army Committee and the Yunghsin County Committee of the Communist Party; he just mechanically enforced the order of the Hunan Provincial Committee and echoed the views of the National Revolutionary Army28th Regiment which wanted to evade struggle and return home, and he mistake was exceedingly grave. The situation arising from the August defeat was salvaged as a result of the corrective measures taken by the Hunan Provincial Committee and the Army Committee of the Party after September...IV. THE ROLE OF THE INDEPENDENT REGIME OF THE HUNAN- KIANGSI BORDER AREA IN Hunan, HUPEH AND KIANGSI..The significance of the armed independent regime of workers and peasants in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area, with Ningkang as Ningkang centre, is definitely not confined to the few counties in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area; the independent regime will play an immense role in the process of the seizure of political power in Hunan, Hupeh and Kiangsi through the insurrection of the workers and peasants in these three provinces. The following are tasks of great importance for the Party in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area in connection with the insurrections unfolding in Hunan, Hupeh and Kiangsi: Extend the influence of China's democratic revolution and of the people's political power in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area to the lower reaches of the rivers in Hunan and Kiangsi and as far as Hupeh; constantly expand the National Revolutionary Army and enhance the National Revolutionary Army quality through struggle so that the National Revolutionary Army can fulfil the National Revolutionary Army mission in the coming general insurrection of the three provinces; enlarge the local armed forces in the counties, that is, the Red Guards and the workers' and peasants' insurrection detachments, and enhance peasants' quality so that peasants' are able to fight the landlords' levies and small armed units now and safeguard the political power of the Hunan-Kiangsi border area in the future; gradually reduce the extent to which local work is dependent on the assistance of the Red Army personnel, so that the Hunan-Kiangsi border area will have the Hunan-Kiangsi border area own personnel to take charge of the work and even provide personnel for the National Revolutionary Army and the expanded territory of the independent regime...V. ECONOMIC PROBLEMS..The shortage of necessities and cash has become a very big problem for the army and the people inside the White encirclement. Because of the tight enemy blockade, necessities such as salt, cloth and medicines have been very scarce and dear all through the past year in the independent border area, which has upset, sometimes to an acute degree, the lives of the masses of the workers, peasants and petty bourgeoisie, [11] as well as of the soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army. the National Revolutionary Army has to fight the enemy and to provision the National Revolutionary Army at one and the same time. the National Revolutionary Army even lacks funds to pay the daily food allowance of five cents per person, which is provided in addition to grain; the soldiers of the Red Army are undernourished, many are ill, and the wounded in the hospitals are worse off. Such difficulties are of course unavoidable before the nation-wide seizure of political power; yet there is a pressing need to overcome the nation-wide seizure of political power to some extent, to make life somewhat easier, and especially to secure more adequate supplies for the National Revolutionary Army. Unless the Party in the border area can kind proper ways to deal with economic problems, the independent regime will have great difficulties during the comparatively long period in which the enemy's rule will remain stable. An adequate solution of these economic problems undoubtedly merits the attention of every the Communist Party member...VI. THE PROBLEM OF MILITARY BASES..the Party in the border area has another task, namely, the consolidation of the military bases at Five Wells [12] and Chiulung. The Five Wells mountain area at the juncture of Yunghsin, Linghsien, Ningkang and Suichuan Counties, and the Chiulung mountain area at the juncture of Yunghsin, Ningkang, Chaling and Lienhua Counties, both of which have topographical advantages, are important military bases not only for the border area at present, but also for insurrections in Hunan, Hupeh and Kiangsi in the future, and this is particularly true of Five Wells, where we have the support of the people as well as a terrain that is especially difficult and strategically important. The way to consolidate these bases is, first, to construct adequate defences, second, to store sufficient grain and, third, to set up comparatively good the National Revolutionary Army hospitals. the Party in the border area must strive to perform these three tasks effectively...\n",

      "Who are our enemies. Who are our friends. This is a question of the first importance for the revolution. The basic reason why all previous revolutionary struggles in China achieved so little was all previous revolutionary struggles in China failure to unite with real friends in order to attack real enemies. A revolutionary party is the guide of the masses, and no revolution ever succeeds when A revolutionary party leads A revolutionary party astray. To ensure that we will definitely achieve success in we and will not lead the masses astray, we must pay attention to uniting with we real friends in order to attack we real enemies. To distinguish real friends from real enemies, we must make a general analysis of the economic status of the various classes in Chinese society and of their respective attitudes towards the revolution...What is the condition of each of the classes in Chinese society...The landlord class and the comprador class.[1] In economically backward and semi-colonial China the landlord class and the comprador class are wholly appendages of the international bourgeoisie, depending upon imperialism for their survival ant growth. These classes represent the most backward and most reactionary relations of production in China and hinder the development of her productive forces. These classes existence is utterly incompatible with the aims of the Chinese revolution. The big landlord and big comprador classes in particular always side with imperialism and constitute an extreme counterrevolutionary group. The big landlord and big comprador classes in particular always side with imperialism and constitute an extreme counterrevolutionary group political representatives are the Ã‰tatistes [2] and the right-wing of the Kuomintang...The middle bourgeoisie. This class represents the capitalist relations of production in China in town and country. The middle bourgeoisie, by which is meant chiefly the national bourgeoisie, [3] is inconsistent in The middle bourgeoisie, by which is meant chiefly the national bourgeoisie, [3] attitude towards the Chinese revolution: the Chinese revolution feel the need for revolution and favour the revolutionary movement against imperialism and the warlords when the Chinese revolution are smarting under the blows of foreign capital and the oppression of the warlords, but the Chinese revolution become suspicious of the Chinese revolution when the Chinese revolution sense that, with the militant participation of the proletariat at home and the active support of the international proletariat abroad, the Chinese revolution is threatening the hope of the Chinese revolution class to attain the status of a big bourgeoisie. Politically, the Chinese revolution stand for the establishment of a state under the rule of a single class, the national bourgeoisie. A self-styled true disciple of Tai Chi-tao [4] wrote in the Chen Pao, [5] Peking, \"Raise your left fist to knock down the imperialists and your right to knock down the Communists.\" These words depict the dilemma and anxiety of this class. It is against interpreting the Kuomintang's Principle of the People's Livelihood according to the theory of class struggle, and the Kuomintang opposes the Kuomintang's alliance with Russia and the admission of Communists [6] and left-wingers. But the Kuomintang attempt to establish a state under the rule of the national bourgeoisie is quite impracticable, because the present world situation is such that the two major forces, revolution and counter-revolution, are locked in final struggle. Each has hoisted a huge banner: one is the red banner of revolution held aloft by the Third International as the rallying point for all the oppressed classes of the world, the other is the white banner of counterrevolution held aloft by the League of Nations as the rallying point for all the counter-revolutionaries of the world. The intermediate classes are bound to disintegrate quickly, some sections turning left to join the revolution, others turning right to join the counter-revolution; there is no room for others to remain \"independent\". Therefore the idea cherished by China's middle bourgeoisie of an \"independent\" revolution in which it would play the primary role is a mere illusion...The petty bourgeoisie. Included in this category are the owner-peasants, [7] the master handicraftsmen, the lower levels of the intellectuals--students, primary and secondary school teachers, lower government functionaries, office clerks, small lawyers--and the small traders. Both because of its size and class character, this class deserves very close attention. The owner-peasants and the master handicraftsmen are The owner-peasants and the master handicraftsmen engaged in small-scale production. Although all strata of this class have the same petty-bourgeois economic status, petty-bourgeois fall into three different sections. The first section consists of those who have some surplus money or grain, that is, those who, by manual or mental labour, earn more each year than those who, by manual or mental labour consume for those who, by manual or mental labour own support. Such people very much want to get rich and are devout worshipers of Marshal Chao; [8] while Such people have no illusions about amassing great fortunes, Such people invariably desire to climb up into The petty bourgeoisie. Such people mouths water copiously when Such people see the respect in which those small moneybags are held. People of this sort are timid, afraid of government officials, and also a little afraid of the revolution. Since People of this sort are quite close to the middle bourgeoisie in economic status, People of this sort have a lot of faith in its propaganda and are suspicious of the revolution. This section is a minority among the petty bourgeoisie and constitutes This section right-wing. This section consists of those who in the main are economically self-supporting. those who in the main are economically self-supporting are quite different from the people in the first section; those who in the main are economically self-supporting also want to get rich, but Marshal Chao never lets those who in the main are economically self-supporting. In recent years, moreover, suffering from the oppression and exploitation of the imperialists, the warlords, the feudal landlords and the big comprador-bourgeoisie, the warlords, the feudal landlords and the big comprador-bourgeoisie have become aware that the world is no longer what the world was. the warlords, the feudal landlords and the big comprador-bourgeoisie feel the warlords, the feudal landlords and the big comprador-bourgeoisie cannot earn enough to live on by just putting in as much work as before. To make both ends meet both have to work longer hours, get up earlier, leave off later, and be doubly careful at both work. both become rather abusive, denouncing the foreigners as \"foreign devils\", the warlords as \"robber generals\" and the local tyrants and evil gentry as \"the heartless rich\". As for the movement against the imperialists and the warlords, the foreigners; merely doubt whether it can succeed (on the ground that the foreigners and the warlords seem so powerful), hesitate to join it and prefer to be neutral, but the foreigners and the warlords never oppose the revolution. This section is very numerous, making up about one-half of the petty bourgeoisie...This section consists of those whose standard of living is falling. Many in this section, who originally belonged to better-off families, are undergoing a gradual change from a position of being barely able to manage to one of living in more and more reduced circumstances. When they come to settle they accounts at the end of each year, they are shocked, exclaiming, \"What. Another deficit.\" As such people have seen better days and are now going downhill with every passing year, such people debts mounting and such people life becoming more and more miserable, such people \"shudder at the thought of the future\". such people are in great mental distress because there is such a contrast between such people past and such people present. Such people are quite important for the revolutionary movement; Such people form a mass of no small proportions and are the left-wing of the petty bourgeoisie. In normal times these three sections of the petty bourgeoisie differ in the petty bourgeoisie attitude to the revolution. But in times of war, that is, when the tide of the revolution runs high and the dawn of victory is in sight, not only will the left-wing of the petty bourgeoisie the petty bourgeoisie join the revolution, but the middle section too may join, and even tight-wingers, swept forward by the great revolutionary tide of the proletariat and of the left-wing of the petty bourgeoisie, will have to go along with the \"evolution.\" We can see from the experience of the May 30th Movement [9] of 1925 and the peasant movement in various places that this conclusion is correct...the proletariat. What is here called the semi-proletariat consists of five categories: (1) the overwhelming majority of the semi-owner peasants, [10] (2) the poor peasants, (3) the small handicraftsmen, (4) the shop assistants [11] and (5) the pedlars. The overwhelming majority of the semi-owner peasants together with the poor peasants constitute a very large part of the rural masses. The peasant problem is essentially The overwhelming majority of the semi-owner peasants together with the poor peasants problem. The semi-owner peasants, the poor peasants and the small handicraftsmen are engaged in production on a still smaller scale than the owner-peasants and the master handicraftsmen. Although both the overwhelming majority of the semi-owner peasants and the poor peasants belong to the proletariat, The semi-owner peasants, the poor peasants and the small handicraftsmen may be further divided into three smaller categories, upper, middle and lower, according to The semi-owner peasants, the poor peasants and the small handicraftsmen economic condition. the semi-owner peasants are worse off than the owner-peasants because every year the semi-owner peasants are short of about half the food the semi-owner peasants need, and have to make up this deficit by renting land from others, selling part of the semi-owner peasants labour power, or engaging in petty trading. In late spring and early summer when the crop is still in the blade and the old stock is consumed, the semi-owner peasants borrow at exorbitant rates of interest and buy grain at high prices; the semi-owner peasants plight is naturally harder than that of the owner-peasants' who need no help from others, but the semi-owner peasants are better off than the semi-owner peasants. For the semi-owner peasants own no land, and receive only half the harvest or even less for the semi-owner peasants year's toil, while the semi-owner` peasants, though receiving only half or less than half the harvest of land rented from others, can keep the entire crop from the land the semi-owner peasants own. the semi-owner peasants are therefore more revolutionary than the owner-peasants, but less revolutionary than the semi-owner peasants. the semi-owner peasants are tenant-peasants who are exploited by the landlords. the semi-owner peasants may again be divided into two categories according to the semi-owner peasants economic status. One category has comparatively adequate farm implements and some funds. Such peasants may retain half the product of Such peasants year's toil. To make up Such peasants deficit Such peasants cultivate side crops, catch fish or shrimps, raise poultry or pigs, or sell part of Such peasants labour power, and thus eke out a living, hoping in the midst of hardship and destitution to tide over the year. Thus their life is harder than that of the semi-owner peasants, but their are better off than the other category of poor peasants. their ate more revolutionary than the semi-owner peasants, but less revolutionary than the other category of poor peasants. As for the latter, their have neither adequate farm implements nor funds nor enough manure, their crops are poor, and, with little left after paying rent, their crops have even greater need to sell part of their crops labour power. In hard times their crops piteously beg help from relatives and friends, borrowing a few tou or sheng of grain to last their crops a few days, and their crops debts pile up like loads on the backs of oxen. their crops are the worst off among the peasants and are highly receptive to revolutionary propaganda. The small handicraftsmen are called semi-proletarians because, though The small handicraftsmen own some simple means of production and moreover are self-employed, The small handicraftsmen too are often forced to sell part of The small handicraftsmen labour power and are somewhat similar to the poor peasants in economic status. The small handicraftsmen feel the constant pinch of poverty and dread of unemployment, because of heavy family burdens and the gap between The small handicraftsmen earnings and the cost of living; in this respect too The small handicraftsmen largely resemble the semi-owner peasants. The shop assistants are employees of shops and stores, supporting The shop assistants families on meagre pay and getting an increase perhaps only once in several years while prices rise every year. If by chance you get into intimate conversation with them, them invariably pour out them endless grievances. Roughly the same in status as the poor peasants and the small handicraftsmen, the poor peasants and the small handicraftsmen are highly receptive to revolutionary propaganda. The pedlars, whether the poor peasants and the small handicraftsmen carry the poor peasants and the small handicraftsmen wares around on a pole or set up stalls along the street, have tiny funds and very small earnings, and do not make enough to feed and clothe the poor peasants and the small handicraftsmen. the poor peasants and the small handicraftsmen status is roughly the same as that of the semi-owner peasants, and like the poor peasants the poor peasants and the small handicraftsmen need a revolution to change the existing state of affairs...the proletariat. The modern industrial proletariat numbers about two million. It is not large because China is economically backward. These two million industrial workers are mainly employed in five industries--railways, mining, maritime transport, textiles and shipbuilding--and a great number are enslaved in enterprises owned by foreign capitalists. Though not very numerous, the proletariat represents China's new productive forces, is the most progressive class in modern China and has become the leading force in the revolutionary movement. We can see the important position of the industrial proletariat in the revolution from the strength it has displayed in the strikes of the last four years, such as the seamen's strikes, [12] the railway strike, [13] the strikes in the Kailan and Tsiaotso coal mines, [14] the Shameen strike [15] and the general strikes in Shanghai and Hong Kong [16] after the May 30th Incident. The first reason why the industrial workers hold this position is the industrial workers concentration. No other section of the people is so concentrated. The second reason is the people low economic status. the people have been deprived of all means of production, have nothing left but the people hands, have no hope of ever becoming rich and, moreover, are subjected to the most ruthless treatment by the imperialists, the warlords and the bourgeoisie. That is why the people are particularly good fighters. The coolies in the cities are also a force meriting attention. The coolies in the cities are mostly dockers and rickshaw men, and among The coolies in the cities, too, are sewage carters and street cleaners. Possessing nothing but The coolies in the cities hands, The coolies in the cities are similar in economic status to the industrial workers but are less concentrated and play a less important role in production. There is as yet little modern capitalist farming in China. By rural proletariat we mean farm labourers hired by the year, the month or the day. Having neither land, farm implements nor funds, funds can live only by selling funds labour power. Of all the workers they work the longest hours, for the lowest wages, under the worst conditions, and with the least security of employment. they are the most hard-pressed people in the villages, and they position in the revolutionary movement is as important as that of the poor peasants...Apart from all these, there is the fairly large lumpen-proletariat, made up of peasants who have lost the fairly large lumpen-proletariat, made up of peasants who have lost their land and handicraftsmen who cannot get work land and handicraftsmen who cannot get work. the fairly large lumpen-proletariat, made up of peasants who have lost their land and handicraftsmen who cannot get work lead the most precarious existence of all. In every part of China the fairly large lumpen-proletariat, made up of peasants who have lost their land and handicraftsmen who cannot get work have the fairly large lumpen-proletariat, made up of peasants who have lost their land and handicraftsmen who cannot get work secret societies, which were originally the fairly large lumpen-proletariat, made up of peasants who have lost their land and handicraftsmen who cannot get work mutual-aid organizations for political and economic struggle, for instance, the Triad Society in Fukien and Kwangtung, the Society of Brothers in Hunan, Hupeh, Kweichow and Szechuan, the Big Sword Society in Anhwei, Honan and Shantung, the Rational Life Society in Chihli [17] and the three northeastern provinces, and the Green Band in Shanghai and elsewhere [18] One of China's difficult problems is how to handle these people. Brave fighters but apt to be destructive, these people can become a revolutionary force if given proper guidance...To sum up, it can be seen that our enemies are all those in league with imperialism--the warlords, the bureaucrats, the comprador class, the big landlord class and the reactionary section of the intelligentsia attached to our enemies. The leading force in the revolution is the proletariat. our closest friends are the entire semi-proletariat and petty bourgeoisie. As for the vacillating middle bourgeoisie, Our closest friends right-wing may become our enemy and Our closest friends left-wing may become our friend but our must be constantly on our guard and not let our guard create confusion within our ranks.\n",

      "ON THE PURELY MILITARY VIEWPOINT.The purely military viewpoint is very highly developed among a number of comrades in the Red Army. It manifests It as follows:..1. These comrades regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks. Some even say, \"If you are good militarily, naturally you are good politically; if you are not good militarily, you cannot be any good politically\"--this is to go a step further and give military affairs a leading position over politics...2. They think that the task of the Red Army like that of the Red Army, is merely to fight. They do not understand that the Red Army is an armed body for carrying out the political tasks of the revolution. Especially at present, the Red Army should certainly not confine the Red Army to fighting; besides fighting to destroy the enemy's military strength, the Red Army should shoulder such important tasks as doing propaganda among the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary political power and setting up Party organizations. the Red Army fights not merely for the sake of fighting but in order to conduct propaganda among the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and help the masses to establish revolutionary political power. Without these objectives, fighting loses fighting meaning and the Red Army loses the reason for the Red Army existence...3. Hence, organizationally, these comrades subordinate the departments of the Red Army doing political work to those doing military work, and put forward the slogan, \"Let Army Headquarters handle outside matters.\" If allowed to develop, this idea would involve the danger of estrangement from the masses, control of the government by the Red Army and departure from proletarian leadership-- it would be to take the path of warlordism like the Red Army...4. At the same time, in propaganda work they overlook the importance of propaganda teams. On the question of mass organization, they neglect the organizing of soldiers' committees in the Red Army and the organizing of the local workers and peasants. As a result, both propaganda and organizational work are abandoned...5. both become conceited when a battle is won and dispirited when a battle is lost...6. Selfish departmentalism--both think only of the Red Army and do not realize that it is an important task of the Red Army to arm the local masses. This is cliquism in a magnified form...7. Unable to see beyond their limited environment in the Red Army, a few comrades believe that no other revolutionary forces exist. Hence no other revolutionary forces extreme addiction to the idea of conserving strength and avoiding action. This is a remnant of opportunism...8. Some comrades, disregarding the subjective and objective conditions, suffer from the malady of revolutionary impetuosity; Some comrades, disregarding the subjective and objective conditions will not take pains to do minute and detailed work among the masses, but, riddled with illusions, want only to do big things. This is a remnant of putschism.[1]..The sources of the purely military viewpoint are:..1. A low political level. From this flows the failure to recognize the role of political leadership in the Red Army and to recognize that the Red Army and the Red Army are fundamentally different...2. The mentality of mercenaries. Many prisoners captured in past battles have joined the Red Army, and such elements bring with Many prisoners a markedly mercenary outlook, thereby providing a basis in the lower ranks for the purely military viewpoint...3. From the two preceding causes there arises a third, overconfidence in military strength and absence of confidence in the strength of the masses of the people...4 The Party's failure actively to attend to and discuss military work is also a reason for the emergence of the purely military viewpoint among a number of comrades...The methods of correction are as follows:..1. Raise the political level in The Party by means of education, destroy the theoretical roots of the purely military viewpoint, and be dear on the fundamental difference between the Red Army and the White army. At the same time, eliminate the remnants of opportunism and putschism and break down the selfish departmentalism of the Fourth Army...2. Intensify the political training of officers and men and especially the education of ex-prisoners. At the same time, as far as possible let the local governments select workers and peasants experienced in struggle to join the Red Army, thus organizationally weakening or even eradicating the purely military viewpoint...3. Arouse the local Party organizations to criticize the Party organizations in the Red Army and the organs of mass political power to criticize the Red Army, in order to influence the Party organizations and the officers and men of the Red Army...4. The Party must actively attend to and discuss military work. military work must be discussed and decided upon by The Party before being carried out by the rank and file...5. Draw up the Red Army rules and regulations which dearly define its tasks, the relationship between its military and its political apparatus, the relationship between the Red Army and the masses of the people, and the powers and functions of the soldiers' committees and the soldiers' relationship with the military and political organizations...ON ULTRA-DEMOCRACY.Since the Fourth Army of the Red Army accepted the directives of the Central Committee, there has been a great decrease in the manifestations of ultra-democracy. For example, The Party decisions are now carried out fairly well; and no longer does anyone bring up such erroneous demands as that the Red Army should apply \"democratic centralism from the bottom to the top\" or should \"let the lower levels discuss all problems first, and then let the higher levels decide\". Actually, however, this decrease is only temporary and superficial and does not mean that ultra-democratic ideas have already been eliminated. In other words, ultra-democracy is still deep-rooted in the minds of many comrades. Witness the various expressions of reluctance to carry out The Party decisions...The methods of correction are as follows:..1. In the sphere of theory, destroy the roots of ultra-democracy. First, it should be pointed out that the danger of ultra-democracy lies in the fact that it damages or even completely wrecks the Party organization and weakens or even completely undermines The Party's fighting capacity, rendering The Party The Party incapable of fulfilling The Party fighting tasks and thereby causing the defeat of the revolution. Next, it should be pointed out that the source of ultra-democracy consists in the petty bourgeoisie's individualistic aversion to discipline. When this characteristic is brought into The Party, this characteristic develops into ultra-democratic ideas politically and organizationally. ultra-democratic ideas are utterly incompatible with the fighting tasks of the proletariat...2. In the sphere of organization, ensure democracy under centralized guidance. It should be done on the following lines:..(1) The leading bodies of The Party must give a correct line of guidance and kind solutions when problems arise, in order to establish themselves as centres of leadership...(2) The higher bodies must be familiar with the life of the masses and with the situation in the lower bodies so as to have an objective basis for correct guidance...(3) No Party organization at any level should make casual decisions in solving problems. Once a decision is reached, a decision must be firmly carried out...(4) All decisions of any importance made by The Party's higher bodies must be promptly transmitted to the lower bodies and the Party rank and file. The method is to call meetings of activists or general membership meetings of the Party branches or even of the columns [2] (when circumstances permit) and to assign people to make reports at such meetings...(5) The lower bodies of the Party and the Party rank and file must discuss the Party's higher bodies directives in detail in order to understand the Party's higher bodies meaning thoroughly and decide on the methods of carrying the Party's higher bodies out...ON THE DISREGARD OF ORGANIZATIONAL DISCIPLINE.Disregard of organizational discipline in the Party organization in the Fourth Army manifests itself as follows:..A. Failure of the minority to submit to the majority. For example, when a minority finds a minority motion voted down, a minority does not sincerely carry out the Party decisions...The methods of correction are as follows:..1. At meetings, all participants should be encouraged to voice all participants opinions as fully as possible. The rights and wrongs in any controversy should be clarified without compromise or glossing over. In order to reach a clear-cut conclusion, what cannot be settled at one meeting should be discussed at another, provided there is no interference with the work...2. One requirement of Party discipline is that the minority should submit to the majority. If the view of the minority has been rejected, the view of the minority has been rejected must support the decision passed by the majority. If necessary, the view of the minority has been rejected can bring up the maker for reconsideration at one meeting, but apart from that the maker must not act against the decision passed by the majority in any way...B. Criticism made without regard to organizational discipline:..1. Inner-Party criticism is a weapon for strengthening the Party organization and increasing the Party organization fighting capacity. In the Party organization of the Red Army, however, criticism is not always of this character, and sometimes turns into personal attack. As a result, personal attack damages the Party organization as well as individuals. This is a manifestation of petty-bourgeois individualism. The method of correction is to help Party members understand that the purpose of criticism is to increase The Party's fighting capacity in order to achieve victory in the class struggle and that it should not be used as a means of personal attack...2. Many The Party members make Many Party members criticisms not inside, but outside, the Party. The reason is that the general membership has not yet grasped the importance of the Party organization (the general membership meetings and so forth), and sees no difference between criticism inside and outside the Party organization of the Red Army. The method of correction is to educate Party members so that Party members understand the importance of Party organization and make Party members criticisms of Party committees or comrades at Party meetings...ON ABSOLUTE EQUALITARIANISM.Absolute equalitarianism became quite serious in the Red Army at one time. Here are some examples. On the matter of allowances to wounded soldiers, there were objections to differentiating between light and serious cases, and the demand was raised for equal allowances for all. When officers rode on horseback, it was regarded not as something necessary for performing officers duties but as a sign of inequality. Absolutely equal distribution of supplies was demanded, and there was objection to somewhat larger allotments in special cases. In the hauling of rice, the demand was made that all should carry the same load on all backs, irrespective of age or physical condition. Equality was demanded in the allotment of billets, and the Headquarters would be abused for occupying larger rooms. Equality was demanded in the assignment of fatigue duties, and there was unwillingness to do a little more than the next man. It even went so far that when there were two wounded men but only one stretcher, neither could be carried away because each refused to yield priority to the other. Absolute equalitarianism, as shown in these examples, is still very serious among officers and soldiers of the Red Army...Absolute equalitarianism, like ultra-democracy in political matters, is the product of a handicraft and small peasant economy--the only difference being that the one manifests the one in material affairs, while the other manifests the one in political affairs...The method of correction: We should point out that, before the abolition of capitalism, absolute equalitarianism is a mere illusion of peasants and small proprietors, and that even under socialism there can be no absolute equality, for material things will then be distributed on the principle of \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his work\" as well as on that of meeting the needs of his work. The distribution of material things in the Red Army must be more or less equal, as in the case of equal pay for officers and men, because this is required by the present circumstances of the struggle. But absolute equalitarianism beyond reason must be opposed because absolute equalitarianism beyond reason is not required by the struggle; on the contrary, absolute equalitarianism beyond reason hinders the struggle...ON SUBJECTIVISM.Subjectivism exists to a serious degree among some Party members, causing great harm to the analysis of the political situation and the guidance of the work. The reason is that subjective analysis of a political situation and subjective guidance of work inevitably result either in opportunism or in putschism. As for subjective criticism, loose and groundless talk or suspiciousness, such practices inside The Party often breed unprincipled disputes and undermine the Party organization...Another point that should be mentioned in connection with inner-Party criticism is that some comrades ignore the major issues and confine some comrades attention to minor points when some comrades make some comrades criticism. some comrades do not understand that the main task of criticism is to point out political and organizational mistakes. As to personal shortcomings, unless they are related to political and organizational mistakes, there is no need to be overcritical and to embarrass the comrades concerned. Moreover, once such criticism develops, there is the great danger that the Party members will concentrate entirely on minor faults, and everyone will become timid and overcautious and forget The Party's political tasks...The main method of correction is to educate Party members so that a political and scientific spirit pervades Party members thinking and Party members Party life. To this end we must: (1) teach Party members to apply the Marxist-Leninist method in analysing a political situation and appraising the class forces, instead of making a subjective analysis and appraisal; (2) direct the attention of Party members to social and economic investigation and study, so as to determine the tactics of struggle and methods of work, and help comrades to understand that without investigation of actual conditions comrades will fall into the pit of fantasy and putschism; and (3) in inner-Party criticism, guard against subjectivism, arbitrariness and the vulgarization of criticism; statements should be based on facts and criticism should centre on politics...ON INDIVIDUALISM.The tendency towards individualism in the Red Army Party organization manifests the Red Army Party organization as follows:..1. Retaliation. Some comrades, after being criticized inside The Party by a soldier comrade, look for opportunities to retaliate outside The Party, and one way is to beat or abuse the comrade in question. Some comrades also seek to retaliate within The Party. \"You have criticized me at one meeting, so I'll find some way to pay you back at the next.\" Such retaliation arises from purely personal considerations, to the neglect of the interests of the class and of The Party as a whole. The Party target is not the enemy class, but individuals in our own ranks. Its target is a corrosive which weakens the organization and Its target fighting capacity...2. \"Small group\" mentality. Some comrades consider only the interests of Some comrades own small group and ignore the general interest. Although on the surface this does not seem to be the pursuit of personal interests, in reality it exemplifies the narrowest individualism and has a strong corrosive and centrifugal effect. \"Small group\" mentality used to be rife in the Red Army, and although there has been some improvement as a result of criticism, there are still survivals and further effort is needed to overcome survivals and further effort...3. The \"employee\" mentality. Some comrades do not understand that the Party and the Red Army, of which Some comrades are members, are both instruments for carrying out the tasks of the revolution. the Party and the Red Army, of which they are members, are both instruments for carrying out the tasks of the revolution do not realize that the Party and the Red Army, of which they are members, are both instruments for carrying out the tasks of the revolution themselves are makers of the revolution, but think that the Party and the Red Army, of which they are members, are both instruments for carrying out the tasks of the revolution responsibility is merely to the Party and the Red Army, of which they are members, are both instruments for carrying out the tasks of the revolution individual superiors and not to the revolution. This passive mentality of an \"employee\" of the revolution is also a manifestation of individualism. It explains why there are not very many activists who work unconditionally for the revolution. Unless it is eliminated, the number of activists will not grow and the heavy burden of the revolution will remain on the shoulders of a small number of people, much to the detriment of the struggle...4. Pleasure-seeking. In the Red Army there are also quite a few people whose individualism finds expression in pleasure-seeking. They always hope that They unit will march into big cities. They want to go there not to work but to enjoy They. The last thing They want is to work in the Red areas where life is hard...5. Passivity. Some comrades become passive and stop working whenever anything goes against Some comrades wishes. This is mainly due to. lack of education, though sometimes it is also due to the leadership's improper conduct of affairs, assignment of work or enforcement of discipline...6. The desire to leave the Red Army. The number of people who ask for transfers from the Red Army to local work is on the increase The reason for this does not lie entirely with the individuals but also with: (1) the material hardships of life in the Red Army, (2) exhaustion after long struggle, and (3) the leadership's improper conduct of affairs, assignment of work or enforcement of discipline...The method of correction is primarily to strengthen education so as to rectify individualism ideologically. Next, it is to conduct affairs, make assignments and enforce discipline in a proper way. In addition, ways must be found to improve the material life of the Red Army, and every available opportunity must be utilized for rest and rehabilitation in order to improve material conditions. In our educational work we must explain that in its social origin individualism is a reflection within the Party of petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ideas...ON THE IDEOLOGY OF ROVING REBEL BANDS.The political ideology of roving rebel bands has emerged in the Red Army because the proportion of vagabond elements is large and because there are great masses of vagabonds in China, especially in the southern provinces. BANDS.The political ideology of roving rebel bands manifests BANDS.The political ideology of roving rebel bands as follows: (1) Some people want to increase our political influence only by means of roving guerrilla actions, but are unwilling to increase it by undertaking the arduous task of building up base areas and establishing the people's political power. (2) In expanding the Red Army, some people follow the line of \"hiring men and buying horses\" and \"recruiting deserters and accepting mutineers\", [3] rather than the line of expanding the local Red Guards and the local troops and thus developing the main forces of the Red Army. (3) Some people lack the patience to carry on arduous struggles together with the masses, and only want to go to the big cities to eat and drink to Some people hearts' content. All these manifestations of the ideology of roving rebels seriously hamper the Red Army in performing the Red Army proper tasks; consequently the Red Army eradication is an important objective in the ideological struggle within the Red Army Party organization. It must be understood that the ways of roving rebels of the Huang Chao [4] or Li Chuang [5] type are not permissible under present-day conditions...The methods of correction are as follows:..1. Intensify education, criticize incorrect ideas, and eradicate the ideology of roving rebel bands...2. Intensify education among the basic sections of the Red Army and among recently recruited captives to counter the vagabond outlook...3. Draw active workers and peasants experienced in struggle into the ranks of the Red Army so as to change the Red Army composition...4. Create new units of the Red Army from among the masses of militant workers and peasants...ON THE REMNANTS OF PUTSCHISM.The Party organization in the Red Army has already waged struggles against putschism, but not yet to a sufficient extent. Therefore, remnants of BANDS.The political ideology of roving rebel bands still exist in the Red Army. Their manifestations are: (1) blind action regardless of subjective and objective conditions; (2) inadequate and irresolute application of The Party's policies for the cities; (3) slack military discipline, especially in moments of defeat; (4) acts of house-burning by some units; and (5) the practices of shooting deserters and of inflicting corporal punishment, both of which smack of putschism. In its social origins, putschism is a combination of lumpen-proletarian and petty- bourgeois ideology.\n",

      "Some comrades in our Party still do not know how to appraise the current situation correctly and how to settle the attendant question of what action to take. Though Some comrades in our Party believe that a revolutionary high tide is inevitable, Some comrades in our Party do not believe it to be imminent. Therefore, Some comrades in our Party disapprove of the plan to take Kiangsi and only approve of roving guerrilla actions in the three areas on the borders of Fukien, Kwangtung and Kiangsi; at the same time, as Some comrades in our Party do not have a deep understanding of what it means to establish Red political power in the guerrilla areas, Some comrades in our Party do not have a deep understanding of the idea of accelerating the nation-wide revolutionary high tide through the consolidation and expansion of Red political power. Some comrades in our Party seem to think that, since the revolutionary high tide is still remote, it will be labour lost to attempt to establish political power by hard work. Instead, Some comrades in our Party want to extend our political influence through the easier method of roving guerrilla actions, and, once the masses throughout the country have been won over, or more or less won over, Some comrades in our Party want to launch a nation-wide armed insurrection which, with the participation of the Red Army, would become a great nationwide revolution. Some comrades in our Party theory that we must first win over the masses on a country-wide scale and in all regions and then establish political power does not accord with the actual state of the Chinese revolution. Their theory that we must first win over the masses on a country-wide scale and in all regions and then establish political power derives mainly from the failure to understand clearly that China is a semi-colonial country for which many imperialist powers are contending. If one clearly understands this, one will understand first why the unusual phenomenon of prolonged and tangled warfare within the ruling classes is only to be found in China, why this warfare is steadily growing fiercer and spreading, and why there has never been a unified regime. Secondly, one will understand the gravity of the peasant problem and hence why rural uprisings have developed on the present country-wide scale. Thirdly, one will understand the correctness of the slogan of workers' and peasants' democratic political power. Fourthly, one will understand another unusual phenomenon, which is also absent outside China, and which follows from the first (that in China there is prolonged and tangled warfare within the ruling classes), namely, the existence and development of the Red Army and the guerrilla forces, and together with the Red Army and the guerrilla forces, the existence and development of small Red areas encircled by the White regime. Fifthly, one will understand that in semi-colonial China the establishment and expansion of the Red Army, the guerrilla forces and the Red areas is the highest form of peasant struggle under the leadership of the proletariat, the inevitable outcome of the growth of the semi-colonial peasant struggle, and undoubtedly the most important factor in accelerating the revolutionary high tide throughout China. And sixthly, one will also understand that the policy which merely calls for roving guerrilla actions cannot accomplish the task of accelerating this nation-wide revolutionary high tide, while the kind of policy adopted by Chu Teh and Mao Tse-tung and also by Fang Chih-min [1] is undoubtedly correct--that is, the policy of establishing base areas; of systematically setting up political power; of deepening the agrarian revolution; of expanding the people's armed forces by a comprehensive process of building up first the township Red Guards, then the district Red Guards, then the county Red Guards, then the local Red Army troops, all the way up to the regular Red Army troops; of spreading political power by advancing in a series of waves; etc., etc. Only thus is it possible to build the confidence of the revolutionary masses throughout China, as the Soviet Union has built it throughout the world. Only thus is it possible to create tremendous difficulties for the reactionary ruling classes, shake the reactionary ruling classes foundations and hasten the reactionary ruling classes internal disintegration. Only thus is it really possible to create a Red Army which will become the chief weapon for the great revolution of the future. In short, only thus is it possible to hasten the revolutionary high tide...Comrades who suffer from revolutionary impetuosity overestimate the subjective forces of the revolution [2] and underestimate the forces of the counter-revolution. Such an appraisal stems mainly from subjectivism. In the end, it undoubtedly leads to putschism. On the other hand, underestimating the subjective forces of the counter-revolution and overestimating the forces of the counter-revolution the counter-revolution would also constitute an improper appraisal and be certain to produce bad results of another kind. Therefore, in judging the political situation in China it is necessary to understand the following:..1. Although the subjective forces of the counter-revolution China are now weak, so also are all organizations (organs of political power, armed forces, political parties, etc.) of the reactionary ruling classes, resting as they do on the backward and fragile social and economic structure of China. This helps to explain why revolution cannot break out at once in the countries of Western Europe where, although the subjective forces of revolution are now perhaps somewhat stronger than in China, the forces of the reactionary ruling classes are many times stronger. In China the counter-revolution will undoubtedly move towards a high tide more rapidly, for although the subjective forces of the counter-revolution at present are weak, the forces of the counter-revolution the counter-revolution are relatively weak too...2. the forces of the counter-revolution the counter-revolution have indeed been greatly weakened since the defeat of the counter-revolution in 1927. the forces of the counter-revolution are very small and those comrades who judge by appearances alone naturally feel pessimistic. But if we judge by essentials, it is quite another story. Here we can apply the old Chinese saying, \"A single spark can start a prairie fire.\" In other words, the forces of the counter-revolution, although small at present, will grow very rapidly. In the conditions prevailing in China, the forces of the counter-revolution growth is not only possible but indeed inevitable, as the May 30th Movement and the counter-revolution which followed have fully proved. When we look at a thing, we must examine a thing essence and treat a thing appearance merely as an usher at the threshold, and once we cross the threshold, we must grasp the essence of the thing; this is the only reliable and scientific method of analysis...3. Similarly, in appraising the counter-revolutionary forces, we must never look merely at their appearance, but should examine their essence. In the initial period of our independent regime in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area, some comrades genuinely believed the incorrect appraisal made by the Hunan Provincial Committee and regarded the class enemy as not worth a rap; the two descriptive terms, \"terribly shaky\" and \"extremely panicky\", which are standing jokes to this day, were used by the Hunan Provincial Committee at the time (from May to June 1928) in appraising the Hunan ruler Lu Ti-ping. [3] Such an appraisal necessarily led to putschism in the political sphere. But during the four months from November of that year to February 1929 (before the war between Chiang Kai-shek and the Kwangsi warlords), [4] when the class enemy's third \"joint suppression expedition\" [5] was approaching the Chingkang Mountains, some comrades asked the question, \"How long can some comrades keep the Red Flag flying.\" As a matter of fact, the struggle in China between Britain, the United States and Japan had by then become quite open, and a state of tangled warfare between Chiang Kai-shek, the Kwangsi clique and Feng Yu-hsiang was taking shape; hence it was actually the time when the counter-revolutionary tide had begun to ebb and the revolutionary tide to rise again. Yet pessimistic ideas were to be found not only in the Red Army and local Party organizations, even the Central Committee was misled by appearances and adopted a pessimistic tone. the Central Committee February letter is evidence of the pessimistic analysis made in Party at that time...4. The objective situation today is still such that comrades who see only the superficial appearance and not the essence of what is before comrades who see only the superficial appearance and not the essence of what is before them are liable to be misled. In particular, when our comrades working in the Red Army are defeated in battle or encircled or pursued by strong enemy forces, our comrades working in the Red Army often unwittingly generalize and exaggerate our comrades working in the Red Army momentary, specific and limited situation, as though the situation in China and the world as a whole gave no cause for optimism and the prospects of victory for the revolution were remote. The reason they seize on the appearance and brush aside the essence in they observation of things is that they have not made a scientific analysis of the essence of the overall situation. The question whether there will soon be a revolutionary high tide in China can be decided only by making a detailed examination to ascertain whether the contradictions leading to a revolutionary high tide are really developing. Since contradictions are developing in the world between the imperialist countries, between the imperialist countries and their colonies, and between the imperialists and the proletariat in their own countries, there is an intensified need for the imperialists to contend for the domination of China. While the imperialist contention over China becomes more intense, both the contradiction between imperialism and the whole Chinese nation and the contradictions among the imperialists themselves develop simultaneously on Chinese soil, thereby creating the tangled warfare which is expanding and intensifying daily and giving rise to the continuous development of the contradictions among the different cliques of China's reactionary rulers. In the wake of the contradictions among the reactionary ruling cliques--the tangled warfare among the warlords--comes heavier taxation, which steadily sharpens the contradiction between the broad masses of taxpayers and the reactionary rulers. In the wake of the contradiction between imperialism and China's national industry comes the failure of the Chinese industrialists to obtain concessions from the imperialists, which sharpens the contradiction between the Chinese bourgeoisie and the Chinese working class, with the Chinese capitalists trying to find a way out by frantically exploiting the workers and with the workers resisting. In the wake of imperialist commercial aggression, Chinese merchant-capitalist extortions, heavier government taxation, etc., comes the deepening of the contradiction between the landlord class and the peasantry, that is, exploitation through rent and usury is aggravated and the hatred of the peasants for the landlords grows. Because of the pressure of foreign goods, the exhaustion of the purchasing power of the worker and peasant masses, and the increase in government taxation, more and more dealers in Chinese-made goods and independent producers are being driven into bankruptcy. Because the reactionary government, though short of provisions and funds, endlessly expands the reactionary government armies and thus constantly extends the warfare, the masses of soldiers are in a constant state of privation. Because of the growth in government taxation, the rise in rent and interest demanded by the landlords and the daily spread of the disasters of war, there are famine and banditry everywhere and the peasant masses and the urban poor can hardly keep alive. Because the schools have no money, many students fear that many students education may be interrupted; because production is backward, many graduates have no hope of employment. Once we understand all these contradictions, we shall see in what a desperate situation, in what a chaotic state, China finds herself. We shall also see that the high tide of revolution against the imperialists, the warlords and the landlords is inevitable, and will come very soon. China China is littered with dry faggots which will soon be aflame. The saying, \"A single spark can start a prairie fire\", is an apt description of how the current situation will develop. We need only look at the strikes by the workers, the uprisings by the peasants, the mutinies of soldiers and the strikes of students which are developing in many places to see that it cannot be long before a \"spark\" kindles \"a prairie fire\"...The gist of the above was already contained in the letter from the Hunan Provincial Committee to the Central Committee on April 5, 1929, which reads in part:..the Central Committeeletter [dated February 9, 1929] makes too pessimistic an appraisal of the objective situation and our subjective forces. The Kuomintang's three \"suppression\" campaigns against the Chingkang Mountains was the high water mark reached by the counter-revolutionary tide. But there the high water mark reached by the counter-revolutionary tide stopped, and since then the counter-revolutionary tide has gradually receded while the revolutionary tide has gradually risen. Although our Party's fighting capacity and organizational strength have been weakened to the extent described by the Central Committee, our Party's fighting capacity and organizational strength have been weakened to the extent described by the Central Committee will be rapidly restored, and the passivity among comrades in Party will quickly disappear as the counter-revolutionary tide gradually ebbs. The masses will certainly come over to us. The Kuomintang's policy of massacre only serves to \"drive the fish into deep waters\", [6] as the saying goes, and reformism no longer has any mass appeal. It is certain that the masses will soon shed the masses illusions about The Kuomintang. In the emerging situation, no other party will be able to compete with Party in winning over the masses. The political line and the organizational line laid down by Party's Sixth National Congress [7] are correct, i.e., the revolution at the present stage is democratic and not socialist, and the present task of Party [here the words \"in the big cities\" should have been added] [8] is to win over the masses and not to stage immediate insurrections. Nevertheless the counter-revolution will develop swiftly, and we should take a positive attitude in we propaganda and preparations for armed insurrections. In the present chaotic situation we can lead the masses only by positive slogans and a positive attitude. Only by taking such an attitude can Party recover Party fighting capacity.... Proletarian leadership is the sole key to victory in the counter-revolution. Building a proletarian foundation for Party and setting up Party branches in industrial enterprises in key districts are important organizational tasks for Party at present; but at the same time the major prerequisites for helping the struggle in the cities and hastening the rise of the revolutionary tide are specifically the development of the struggle in the countryside, the establishment of Red political power in small areas, and the creation and expansion of the Red Army. Therefore, it would be wrong to abandon the struggle in the citiesthe cities, but in our opinion it would also be wrong for any of our Party members to fear the growth of peasant strength lest it should outstrip the workers' strength and harm the counter-revolution. For in the revolution in semi-colonial China, the peasant struggle must always fail if the peasant struggle does not have the leadership of the workers', but the counter-revolution is never harmed if the peasant struggle outstrips the forces of the workers'...Its February letter also contained the following reply on the question of the Red Army operational tactics:..To preserve the Red Army and arouse the masses, the Central Committee asks us to divide us forces into very small units and disperse our forces over the countryside and to withdraw Chu Teh and Mao Tse-tung from the Red Army, so concealing the major targets. This is an unrealistic view. In the winter of 1927-28, us did plan to disperse our forces over the countryside, with each company or battalion operating on the Red Army own and adopting guerrilla tactics in order to arouse the masses while trying not to present a target for the enemy; us have tried this out many times, but have failed every time. The reasons are: (1) most of the soldiers in the main force of the Red Army come from other areas and have a background different from that of the local Red Guards; (2) division into small units results in weak leadership and inability to cope with adverse circumstances, which easily leads to defeat; (3) the units are liable to be crushed by the enemy one by one; (4) the more adverse the circumstances, the greater the need for concentrating our forces and for the leaders to be resolute in struggle, because only thus can our have internal unity against the enemy. Only in favourable circumstances is it advisable to divide our forces for guerrilla operations, and it is only then that the leaders need not stay with the ranks all the time, as the leaders must in adverse circumstances...The weakness of this passage is that the reasons adduced against the division of forces were of a negative character, which was far from adequate. The positive reason for concentrating our forces is that only concentration will enable our to wipe out comparatively large enemy units and occupy towns. Only after our have wiped out comparatively large enemy units and occupied towns can we arouse the masses on a broad scale and set up political power extending over a number of adjoining counties. Only thus can our make a widespread impact (what we call \"extending our political influence\"), and contribute effectively to speeding the day of the revolutionary high tide. For instance, both the regime we set up in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area the year before last and the one we set up in western Fukien last year [9] were the product of this policy of concentrating we troops. This is a general principle. But are there not times when our forces should be divided up. Yes, there are. The letter from the Hunan Provincial Committee to the Central Committee says of guerrilla tactics for the Red Army, including the division of forces within a short radius:..The tactics we have derived from the struggle of the past three years are indeed different from any other tactics, ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign. With our tactics, the masses can be aroused for struggle on an ever-broadening scale, and no enemy, however powerful, can cope with our. our are guerrilla tactics. our consist mainly of the following points:..\"Divide our forces to arouse the masses, concentrate our forces to deal with the enemy.\"..\"The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.\"..\"To extend stable base areas, [10] employ the policy of advancing in waves; when pursued by a powerful enemy, employ the policy of circling around.\"..\"Arouse the largest numbers of the masses in the shortest possible time and by the best possible methods.\"..These tactics are just like casting a net; at any moment we should be able to cast it or draw it in. we cast it wide to win over the masses and draw it in to deal with the enemy. Such are the tactics we have used for the past three years...Here, \"to cast the net wide\" means to divide we forces within a short radius. For example, when we first captured the county town of Yunghsin in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area, we divided the forces of the 29th and 31st Regiments within the boundaries of Yunghsin County. Again, when we captured Yunghsin for the third time, we once more divided we forces by dispatching the 28th Regiment to the border of Anfu County, the 29th to Lienhua, and the 31st to the border of Kian County. And, again, we divided we forces in the counties of southern Kiangsi last April and May, and in the counties of western Fukien last July. As to dividing our forces over a wide radius, it is possible only on the two conditions that circumstances are comparatively favourable and the leading bodies fairly strong. For the purpose of dividing up our forces is to put our in a better position for winning over the masses, for deepening the counter-revolution and establishing political power, and for expanding the Red Army and the local armed units. It is better not to divide our forces when this purpose cannot be attained or the division of our would lead to defeat and to the weakening of the Red Army, as happened in August two years ago when our were divided on the Hunan-Kiangsi border for an attack on Chenchou. But there is no doubt that, given the two above-mentioned conditions, we should divide we , because division is then more advantageous than concentration. the Central CommitteeFebruary letter was not in the right spirit and had a bad effect on a number of Party comrades in the Red Army. At that time the Central Committee also issued a circular stating that war would not necessarily break out between Chiang Kai-shek and the Kwangsi warlords. Since then, however, the appraisals and directives of the Central Committee have in the main been correct. the appraisals and directives of the Central Committee has already issued another circular correcting the one containing the wrong appraisal. Although the appraisals and directives of the Central Committee has not made any correction of the letter to the Red Army, the Red Army subsequent directives have not been couched in the same pessimistic tone and the Red Army views on the Red Army operations now coincide with ours. Yet the bad effect which the letter to the Red Army had on some comrades persists. Therefore, I feel that it is still necessary to give some explanation...The plan to take Kiangsi Province within a year was also proposed last April by the Hunan Provincial Committee to the Central Committee, and a decision to that effect was later made at Yutu. The following reasons were given in the letter to the Central Committee:..The armies of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kwangsi warlords are approaching each other in the vicinity of Kiukiang, and a big battle is imminent. The resumption of mass struggle, coupled with the spread of contradictions among the ruling reactionaries, makes it probable that there will soon be a high tide of revolution. As for how our work should be arranged under these circumstances, our feel that, so far as the southern provinces are concerned, the armed forces of the compradors and landlords in Kwangtung and Hunan Provinces are too strong, and that in Hunan, more over, our have lost almost all our mass following, inside as well as outside Party, because of Party's putschist mistakes. In the three provinces of Fukien, Kiangsi and Chekiang, however, the situation is different. First, militarily the enemy is weakest there. In Chekiang, there is only a small provincial force under Chiang Po-cheng. [11] In Fukien, although there are five groups of enemy troops totalling fourteen regiments in all, Kuo Fengming's troops have already been smashed; the troops under Chen Kuo-hui and Lu Hsing-pang [12] are bandits of small fighting capacity; the two brigades of marines stationed along the coast have never seen action and the two brigades of marines stationed along the coast fighting capacity is undoubtedly not high; Chang Chen [13] alone can put up some sort of a fight, but, according to an analysis made by the Central Committee, even Chang Chen has only two relatively strong regiments. In addition, Fukien is now in a state of complete chaos, confusion and disunity. In Kiangsi, there are sixteen regiments under the two commands of Chu Pei-teh [14] and Hsiung Shih-hui; [15] they are stronger than the armed forces of either Fukien or Chekiang, but far inferior to those of Hunan. Secondly, fewer putschist mistakes have been made in those of Hunan. We are not clear about the situation in Chekiang, but Party's organizational and mass base is somewhat better in Kiangsi and Fukien than in Hunan. Take Kiangsi for example. In Kiangsi We still have some basis in Tehan, Hsiushui and Tungku; in western Kiangsi the Party and the Red Guards still have some strength in Ningkang, Yunghsin, Lienhua and Suichuan; in southern Kiangsi the prospects are still brighter, as the 2nd and 4th Regiments of` the Red Army are steadily growing in strength in the counties of Kian, Yungfeng and Hsingkuo; and what is more, the Red Army under Fang Chih-min has by no means been wiped out. All this places us in a position to close in on Nanchang. We hereby recommend to the Central Committee that during the period of prolonged warfare among the Kuomintang warlords, we should contend with Chiang Kai-shek and the Kwangsi clique for Kiangsi Province and also for western Fukien and western Chekiang. In those of Hunan we should enlarge the Red Army and create an independent regime of the masses, with a time limit of one year for accomplishing The plan to take Kiangsi Province within a year...This proposal to contend for Kiangsi erred only in setting a time limit of one year. This proposal to contend for Kiangsi erred only in setting a time limit of one year was based not only on conditions within Kiangsi Province, but also on the prospect that a nation-wide high tide of revolution would soon arise. For unless we had been convinced that there would soon be a high tide of revolution, we could not possibly have concluded that we could take Kiangsi in a year. The only weakness in This proposal to contend for Kiangsi erred only in setting a time limit of one year was that This proposal to contend for Kiangsi erred only in setting a time limit of one year set a time limit of one year, which This proposal to contend for Kiangsi erred only in setting a time limit of one year should not have done, and so gave a flavour of impetuosity to the word \"soon\" in the statement, \"there will soon be a high tide of revolution\". As to the subjective and objective conditions in Kiangsi, they well deserve our attention. Besides the subjective conditions described in the letter to the Central Committee, three objective conditions can now be clearly pointed out. First, the economy of Kiangsi is mainly feudal, the merchant-capitalist class is relatively weak, and the armed forces of the landlords are weaker than in any other southern province. Secondly, Kiangsi has no provincial troops of Kiangsi own and has always been garrisoned by troops from other provinces. Sent there for the \"suppression of Communists\" or \"suppression of bandits\", these troops are unfamiliar with local conditions, these troops interests are much less directly involved than if these troops were local troops, and these troops usually lack enthusiasm. And thirdly, unlike Kwangtung which is close to Hongkong and under British control in almost every respect, Kiangsi is comparatively remote from imperialist influence. Once we have grasped these three points, we can understand why rural uprisings are more widespread and the Red Army and guerrilla units more numerous in Kiangsi than in any other province...How then should we interpret the word \"soon\" in the statement, \"there will soon be a high tide of revolution\". This is a common question among comrades. Marxists are not fortune-tellers. Marxists should, and indeed can, only indicate the general direction of future developments and changes; Marxists should not and cannot fix the day and the hour in a mechanistic way. But when I say that there will soon be a high tide of revolution in China, I am emphatically not speaking of something which in the words of some people \"is possibly coming\", something illusory, unattainable and devoid of significance for action. It is like a ship far out at sea whose mast-head can already be seen from the shore; it is like the morning sun in the east whose shimmering rays are visible from a high mountain top; it is like a child about to be born moving restlessly in to be born mother's womb.\n",

      "There are two questions which comrades have failed to stress during the discussion and which, I feel, should be dealt with...The first concerns the well-being of the masses...Our central task at present is to mobilize the broad masses to take part in the revolutionary war, overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang by means of such war, spread the revolution throughout the country, and drive imperialism out of China Anyone who does not attach enough importance to this central task is not a good revolutionary cadre. If our comrades really comprehend this central task and understand that the revolution must at all costs be spread throughout the country, then our comrades should in no way neglect or underestimate the question of the immediate interests, the well-being, of the broad masses. For the revolutionary war is a war of the masses; the revolutionary war can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses...If we only mobilize the people to carry on the revolutionary war and do nothing else, can we succeed in defeating the enemy. Of course not. If we want to win, we must do a great deal more. We must lead the peasants' struggle for land and distribute land to the peasants', heighten the peasants' labour enthusiasm and increase agricultural production, safeguard the interests of the workers, establish co-operatives, develop trade with outside areas, and solve the problems facing the masses-- food, shelter and clothing, fuel, rice, cooking oil and salt, sickness and hygiene, and marriage. In shots, all the practical problems in the masses' everyday life should claim our attention. If we attend to all the practical problems in the masses' everyday life, solve all the practical problems in the masses' everyday life and satisfy the needs of the masses, we shall really become organizers of the well-being of the masses, and all the practical problems in the masses' everyday life will truly rally round us and give us all the practical problems in the masses' everyday life warm support. Comrades, will us then be able to arouse all the practical problems in the masses' everyday life to take part in the revolutionary war. Yes, indeed us will...Here is the kind of thing us have found among some of us cadres. all the practical problems in the masses' everyday life talk only about expanding the Red Army, enlarging the transport corps, collecting the land tax and selling bonds; as for other matters, all the practical problems in the masses' everyday life neither discuss nor attend to all the practical problems in the masses' everyday life, and even ignore all the practical problems in the masses' everyday life altogether. For instance, there was a time when the Tingchow Municipal Government concerned the Tingchow Municipal Government only with the expansion of the Red Army and with mobilization for the transport corps and paid not the slightest attention to the well-being of the masses. The problems facing the people of Tingchow city were that the people of Tingchow city had no firewood, no salt was on sale because the capitalists were hoarding no salt, some people had no houses to live in, and rice was both scarce and dear. These were practical problems for the masses of the people of Tingchow and These eagerly looked to us for help in solving These. But the Tingchow Municipal Government did not discuss any of these matters. That is why when the new workers' and peasants' representative council was elected in Tingchow city, a hundred or more representatives were unwilling to attend after the first few council meetings had discussed only the expansion of the Red Army and mobilization for the transport corps, entirely ignoring the well-being of the masses, so that peasants' representative council was unable to go on meeting. The result was that very little was achieved in regard to the expansion of the Red Army and mobilization for the transport corps. That was one kind of situation...Comrades. You have probably read the pamphlets given you about two model townships. There the situation is entirely different. What a great number of people have joined the Red Army from Changkang Township in Kiangsi [1] and Tsaihsi Township in Fukien.[2] In Changkang 80 per cent of the young men and women have joined the Red Army, and in Tsaihsi the figure is 88 per cent. There has been a big sale of bonds, too, and 4,500 yuan worth have been sold in Changkang which has a population of 1,500. Much has also been done in other fields. What accounts for this. A few examples will make the point clear. In Changkang when fire broke out in a poor peasant's house destroying one and a half rooms, the Tingchow Municipal Government appealed to the masses to contribute money to help a poor peasant. In another instance, three persons were starving, so the township government and the mutual-aid society immediately gave three persons rice. During the food shortage last summer, the Tingchow Municipal Government obtained rice from Kunglueh County,[3] more than two hundred li away, for the relief of the masses. Excellent work was done along these lines in Tsaihsi as well. Such township governments are really models. Such township governments are absolutely different from the Tingchow Municipal Government with the Tingchow Municipal Government bureaucratic methods of leadership. We should learn from Changkang and Tsaihsi Townships and oppose bureaucratic leaders like those in Tingchow city...I earnestly suggest to this congress that we pay close attention to the well-being of the masses, from the problems of land and labour to those of fuel, rice, cooking oil and salt. The women want to learn ploughing and harrowing. Whom can we get to teach The women. The children want to go to school. Have we set up primary schools. The wooden bridge over there is too narrow and people may fall off. Should we not repair The wooden bridge over there. Many people suffer from boils and other ailments. What are we going to do about The wooden bridge over there. All such problems concerning the well-being of the masses should be placed on we agenda. we should discuss them, adopt and carry out decisions and check up on the results. we should convince the masses that we represent their interests, that we lives are intimately bound up with their. we should help their to proceed from these things to an understanding of the higher tasks which we have put forward, the tasks of the revolutionary war, so that their will support the revolution and spread the revolution throughout the country, respond to we political appeals and fight to the end for victory in the revolution. The masses in Changkang say, \"The Communist Party is really good. \"The Communist Party has thought of everything on we behalf.\" The comrades in Changkang Township are an example to all of we. What admirable people. What admirable people have won the genuine affection of the broad masses, who support What admirable people call for war mobilization. Do we want to win the support of the masses. Do we want What admirable people to devote What admirable people strength to the front. If so, we must be with so, arouse so enthusiasm and initiative, be concerned with so well-being, work earnestly and sincerely in so interests and solve all so problems of production and everyday life--the problems of salt, rice, housing, clothing, childbirth, etc. If we do so, the masses will surely support we and regard the revolution as the masses most glorious banner, as the masses very life. In the event of a Kuomintang attack on the Red areas they will fight Kuomintang to the death. There can be no doubt about this, for is it not a plain fact that we have smashed the enemy's first, second, third and fourth \"encirclement and suppression\" campaigns...Kuomintang is now pursuing a policy of blockhouse warfare,[4] feverishly constructing their \"tortoise-shells\" as though Kuomintang were iron bastions. Comrades. Are Comrades really iron bastions. Not in the least. Think of the palaces of the feudal emperors over thousands of years, were the palaces of the feudal emperors over thousands of years not powerful with the palaces of the feudal emperors over thousands of years walls and moats. Yet the palaces of the feudal emperors over thousands of years crumbled one after another the moment the masses arose. The tsar of Russia was one of the world's most ferocious rulers, yet when the proletariat and the peasantry rose in revolution, was there anything left of The tsar of Russia. No, nothing. The tsar of Russia bastions of iron. They all crumbled. Comrades. What is a true bastion of iron. It is the masses, the millions upon millions of people who genuinely and sincerely support the revolution. That is the real iron bastion which no force can smash, no force whatsoever. the revolution cannot smash us; on the contrary, we shall smash the revolution. Rallying millions upon millions of people round the revolutionary government and expanding our revolutionary war we shall wipe out all counter-revolution and take over the whole of China...The second question concerns our methods of work...our are the leaders and organizers of the revolutionary war as well as the leaders and organizers of the life of the masses. To organize the revolutionary war and to improve the life of the masses the masses are our two major tasks. In this respect, our are faced with the serious problem of methods of work. It is not enough to set tasks, we must also solve the problem of the methods for carrying them out. If our task is to cross a river, our cannot cross our task is to cross a river without a bridge or a boat. Unless the bridge or boat problem is solved, it is idle to speak of crossing the river. Unless the problem of method is solved, talk about the task is useless. Unless we pay attention to giving leadership to the work of expanding the Red Army and devote particular care to our methods, our will never succeed even though our recite the phrase \"Expand the Red Army\" a thousand times. Nor can we accomplish we tasks in any other field, for instance, in checking up on land distribution, or in economic construction, or culture and education, or our work in the new areas and the outlying districts, if all we do is to set the tasks without attending to the methods of carrying the tasks out, without combating bureaucratic methods of work and adopting practical and concrete ones, and without discarding commandist methods and adopting the method of patient persuasion...The comrades in Changkang Township have done first-rate work and deserve our praise as model workers. Similarly, The comrades in Changkang Township have done good work and are also model workers. By linking the problem of the well-being of the masses with that of the revolutionary war, the comrades in both these places are simultaneously solving the problems of revolutionary methods of work and of accomplishing the comrades in both these places revolutionary tasks. the comrades in both these places are working conscientiously, solving problems with minute care and shouldering the comrades in both these places revolutionary responsibilities in earnest; the comrades in both these places are good organizers and leaders both of revolutionary war and of the well-being of the masses. Elsewhere, too, The comrades in Changkang Township have made progress in The comrades in Changkang Township work and deserve our praise--as in some parts of the counties of Shanghang, Changting and Yungting in Fukien Province; in Hsikiang and other places in southern Kiangsi Province; in some parts of the counties of Chaling, Yunghsin and Kian in the Hunan-Kiangsi border area; in some parts of Yanghsin County in the Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi border area; in districts and townships of many other counties in Kiangsi Province and in the county of Juichin which is directly under the Tingchow Municipal Government...In all the places under our leadership, there are undoubtedly many active cadres, excellent comrades, who have sprung from the masses. The comrades in Changkang Township have a responsibility to help in places where our work is weak and to help comrades who are not yet able to work well. our are in the midst of a great revolutionary war; our must break through the enemy's large-scale \"encirclement and suppression\" and spread the revolution to all parts of the country. All revolutionary cadres have a tremendous responsibility. After this congress we must adopt effective measures to improve we work, the advanced areas should become even more advanced, and the backward areas should catch up with the advanced. We must create thousands of townships like Changkang and scores of counties like Hsingkuo. thousands of townships like Changkang and scores of counties like Hsingkuo will be our strongholds. From our strongholds we should go forth to smash the enemy's \"encirclement and suppression\" campaigns and overthrow the rule of imperialism and Kuomintang throughout the country...\n",
